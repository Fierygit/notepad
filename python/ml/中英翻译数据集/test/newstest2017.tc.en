28 @-@ Year @-@ Old Chef Found Dead at San Francisco Mall
a 28 @-@ year @-@ old chef who had recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the stairwell of a local mall this week .
but the victim &apos;s brother says he can &apos;t think of anyone who would want to hurt him , saying , &quot; Things were finally going well for him . &quot;
the body found at the Westfield Mall Wednesday morning was identified as 28 @-@ year @-@ old San Francisco resident Frank Galicia , the San Francisco Medical Examiner &apos;s Office said .
the San Francisco Police Department said the death was ruled a homicide and an investigation is ongoing .
the victim &apos;s brother , Louis Galicia , told ABC station KGO in San Francisco that Frank , previously a line cook in Boston , had landed his dream job as line chef at San Francisco &apos;s Sons &amp; Daughters restaurant six months ago .
a spokesperson for Sons &amp; Daughters said they were &quot; shocked and devastated &quot; by his death .
&quot; we are a small team that operates like a close knit family and he will be dearly missed , &quot; the spokesperson said .
our thoughts and condolences are with Frank &apos;s family and friends at this difficult time .
Louis Galicia said Frank initially stayed in hostels , but recently , &quot; Things were finally going well for him . &quot;
&quot; he found an apartment , he was dating a girl , &quot; Louis Galicia told KGO .
Louis Galicia said he could not think of anyone who would want to hurt his younger brother .
he was a kind spirit with a big heart .
his way of connecting with the family was always making us a dish , making us dinner , &quot; Louis Galicia said .
he never wanted to be in any kind of altercation .
he was the brother that went with the flow .
&quot; with everything else that &apos;s going wrong with the world , he was that diamond in the rough that was shining bright every day , &quot; he said .

junior doctors strike : calls for fresh industrial action
representatives of junior doctors have called on their union to authorise fresh industrial action in their dispute about a new contract .
the Junior Doctors Committee ( JDC ) of the British Medical Association ( BMA ) is to ask its full council to back more industrial action from early September .
the JDC says ministers have failed to address concerns about the contract .
junior doctors and medical students voted in July to reject a contract deal agreed with the BMA .
it was rejected by 58 % of its members who voted in the ballot .
in a letter to members released on Twitter on Thursday night , the JDC &apos;s chair Ellen McCourt said the government had remained &quot; persistently silent &quot; on issues which , she said , had resulted in the contract being rejected .
she said : &quot; in light of this , the JDC Executive has voted to reject the proposed new contract in full and to call for formal re @-@ negotiations on all of your concerns . &quot;
in response to the government &apos;s silence , JDC exec has today made a formal request for a special meeting of BMA Council to authorise a rolling programme of escalated industrial action beginning in early September .
the dispute has led to junior doctors taking part in six strikes this year , including the first all @-@ out stoppages in the history of the NHS .
the BMA &apos;s junior doctor leader , Dr Johann Malawana , resigned following the vote to reject the negotiated terms of the contract , which the BMA had recommended .
he had told BMA members the deal was a good one that should be accepted , during meetings ahead of the poll of 54,000 junior doctors and medical students .
following the vote , Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the contract would be imposed on medics in England .
Russia and Turkey : an &apos; alliance of misfits &apos; ?
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and declare a formal end to an eight @-@ month long war of words and economic sanctions .
but , as Vladimir Putin greeted his Turkish counterpart in the gilded hall of a St. Petersburg palace , I got the distinct impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most .
there was the handshake , yes .
but Mr Putin &apos;s smile looked thin and he was hardly oozing warmth even by his own restrained standards .
Recep Tayyip Erdogan by contrast talked repeatedly of his &quot; dear friend &quot; Mr Putin - five times , according to one report .
I lost count .
he also pledged that relations with Russia would return not just to their pre @-@ crisis level , but even higher .
the next day one newspaper here described Mr Erdogan as acting as if nothing bad had ever happened .
to me , his enthusiasm implied the opposite .
but a lingering coolness emanating from Mr Putin showed that Russia &apos;s leader has forgotten nothing .
in fact , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening comments : Turkey &apos;s shooting down of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border .
Moscow &apos;s reaction at the time was furious .
Mr Putin lashed out , accusing Ankara of stabbing Moscow in the back .
the offence was even greater , coming from a supposed friend .
rebuilding real trust will be hard , perhaps impossible .
Russian public opinion has also turned since November .
for months , state @-@ controlled media conducted a staggering , all @-@ out offensive against Ankara .
all of a sudden , it seemed like Turks were to blame for everything .
most serious were accusations from top officials that Mr Erdogan &apos;s own family has profited from an illegal trade in oil from areas of Syria controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he &apos;s denied that emphatically .
but in St. Petersburg came the official message that it &apos;s time to move on .
after all , this meeting only happened because Mr Putin got the apology he demanded from President Erdogan .
Russia could claim a victory of sorts .
for Ankara the benefits of calling a truce are clear .
first and foremost , Erdogan needs all the friends he can get after he was nearly ousted from power last month in a failed coup .
repeat terror attacks on Turkey have clearly shaken him too .
there is also an economic motive .
Russian sanctions have hit hard - particularly the ban on charter flights , which usually carry several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year .
the number has slumped by almost 90 % .
as for Russia , tour operators and charter companies here will certainly be relieved when flights eventually resume .
they &apos;re banking on a late @-@ season rush to the Mediterranean .
and even this week , state TV has been predicting cheaper fruit and vegetables once Turkish agricultural imports are permitted again .
&quot; tourists that way , tomatoes back here , &quot; as a report in Vedemosti newspaper phrased it .
but the visit also had additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is angry with the West for what it considers a weak response to the attempted takeover .
add to that its long @-@ standing grudge at the snail &apos;s pace of talks to join the EU and step in Mr Putin - who is keen to capitalise on the chill and chip away at Turkey &apos;s ties with the West .
the Russian leader certainly won bonus points with Ankara for calling in support of the elected authorities after the attempted coup .
mind you , that &apos;s a given for Moscow which has its own deep @-@ seated fear of regime change .
so the summit at this glitzy , seaside palace allowed Russia and Turkey to present what one analyst described to me as an &quot; alliance of misfits &quot; : two countries that feel rejected and mistreated by the West , joining forces .
still , despite the public display of reconciliation , the two still have major differences .
the key one is Syria , where Moscow has recently been casting itself as peacemaker but where Russia and Turkey back opposite sides .
it could be telling that after almost three hours of initial talks , the two presidents told a press conference that they hadn &apos;t even touched on the topic .
Turkey &apos;s president deliberately avoided answering a question on their differences , while Mr Putin chose to underline them .
there is no clear consensus on where they can seek common ground on Syria .
but after months of open hostility - and given the potential for utter disaster when Nato member Turkey shot down that Russian fighter jet - it is surely better that the two leaders are at least talking again .
Royal Bank of Scotland to disappear for customers outside Scotland
the brand RBS is to be reduced to a back office role , according to the bank &apos;s chief executive .
Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for customers outside Scotland .
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was associated with the bank &apos;s global ambitions .
it has retreated from them since it nearly collapsed eight years ago and had to be bailed out .
during that time , brand strategists have used &apos; RBS &apos; to protect other consumer finance brands .
it was backed with millions of pounds in sponsorship of international sport , from Six Nations rugby to Wimbledon champion Andy Murray .
but now , it has been judged right to let more national brands come to the fore .
Royal Bank of Scotland will be used with Scottish customers , but will not be initialised .
in England and Wales , all RBS references , outside head office and the stock exchange listing , will be changed to NatWest .
the Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other , smaller brands for private banking , which will get more prominence - Coutts , Adam &amp; Co , Drummond , and Holt &apos;s Military Bank .
Mr McEwan was interviewed during a tour of customers and staff in Inverness @-@ shire .
he told BBC Scotland : &quot; the RBS brand will end up becoming our investor brand and the one that our staff are employed with , because we are now becoming much more a bank of brands . &quot;
as the bank itself became a global brand , RBS became the global brand .
I &apos;m now saying we no longer have global aspirations , we have local aspirations .
each one of those brands will stand for something quite different in their own communities , and our staff will work with customers under those brands .
RBS had already stated that it would not to continue its Six Nations sponsorship , and it has been raising the profile of different brands in its sports sponsorship .
&quot; the time is right for us to move to the bank of brands , because underneath ( we &apos;ve been asking ) how do we focus on making this a better bank for customers ? &quot; said the chief executive .
it would have been very cynical three years ago if we &apos;d said we &apos;re going to be a great bank for customers and put those brands out there .
but with the work we &apos;ve been doing , focussing on the customers needs , not our own , I think you &apos;re seeing a lot of change .
we can bring those brands back up again , so I think the time is right .
Frankie Dettori reaches 3,000 winners with victory at Newmarket on predilection
Dettori sprays champagne after a double at Newmarket takes him to 3,000 wins
Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th British winner at Newmarket on Friday .
he brought up the landmark with his second winner of the night at his local track - on predilection , trained by John Gosden .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach the landmark in Flat racing .
he follows Sir Gordon Richards , Doug Smith , Lester Piggott , Pat Eddery and Willie Carson .
three @-@ time champion jockey Dettori , who earlier won on Ghayyar , said : &quot; it &apos;s special . &quot;
I &apos;m very emotional because my family are here as well
I &apos;m very pleased for it to have happened at Newmarket because this is where I landed 30 years ago .
it &apos;s not a big meeting , it &apos;s not a Royal Ascot - it &apos;s a mundane Friday night with 20,000 people .
I &apos;m relieved and very humble .
Dettori soaks up the cheers as he brings in predilection after victory
two jockeys have reached the milestone in jump racing - champion jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20 @-@ time champion Sir Anthony McCoy , who had more than 4,300 victories in a record @-@ breaking career .
Lester Piggott , nine @-@ time Derby winner , 4,493 career wins
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of the modern era and it is no surprise he has reached this landmark so few have achieved before him .
he is stylish and strong , but it is his tactical nous that sets him apart from others in the weighing room .
he is a fantastic ambassador for racing , his enthusiasm and charisma have been drawing fans to the sport for years .
I said to Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom he &apos;d have ridden 6,000 winners if he wasn &apos;t just a weekend and big @-@ race jockey !
seriously though , Frankie &apos;s been riding winners in the UK for the best part of 30 years which is great to see .
he &apos;s a lively character which is good for British racing but more than that , he &apos;s an incredible jockey .
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a trademark flying dismount
from flying finishes to flying dismounts , Frankie Dettori has been the poster boy of British Flat racing for two decades .
it has been a rollercoaster ride .
stacks of big @-@ race winners , including his famous 1996 &apos; Magnificent Seven &apos; at Ascot , but he also survived a plane crash and served a drugs ban .
three years ago he initially struggled when returning from that six @-@ month suspension , but he showed formidable strength of character to defy the doubters and return to his best .
and he may not be done for some time - Dettori has previously said he would like to carry on competing until the age of 50 , at least .
Russia &apos;s Putin sacks chief of staff Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly dismissed his chief of staff Sergei Ivanov .
Mr Ivanov has been part of Mr Putin &apos;s trusted inner circle for many years .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old has now been made a special representative for environmental and transport issues .
a statement from the Kremlin said that Mr Putin had &quot; decreed to relieve Ivanov of his duties as head of the Russian presidential administration , &quot; but gave no reason .
Mr Ivanov &apos;s deputy since 2012 , Anton Vaino , has been appointed as his successor .
Mr Vaino , 44 , is a former diplomat .
born in the Estonian capital Tallinn in 1972 , he graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations ( MGIMO ) and served in the Tokyo embassy .
later he managed presidential protocol and government staff , the Kremlin website says ( in Russian ) .
on being appointed , he told Mr Putin : &quot; thank you for your trust . &quot;
I think the administration &apos;s most important task is to support your activity as head of state in terms of drafting laws and control over how your instructions are implemented .
Mr Putin told a Russian TV station on Friday that Mr Ivanov had asked to leave the post , and recommended that Mr Vaino should replace him .
do the smiles convince ?
this is a move that has mystified Moscow .
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin &apos;s closest allies and , like him , served in the Soviet security service , the KGB .
as chief of staff he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
in a meeting with President Putin shown on state television both men claimed that the chief of staff was stepping down at his own request .
but despite the smiles for the cameras , few here are convinced - especially now , just before parliamentary elections .
so is this the fall @-@ out from some kind of power struggle ?
no @-@ one knows yet .
but the official claim - that a man once touted as a potential president , suddenly wanted to run Russia &apos;s environmental policy - has been met with great scepticism .
in remarks to Mr Putin , quoted on the Kremlin website , Mr Ivanov said &quot; it &apos;s true that in early 2012 I asked you , in a conversation , to entrust me with this very complicated post , even - you could say - troublesome post , for four years .
well , it turns out that I &apos;ve been presidential chief of staff for four years and eight months .
Mr Ivanov took up the post in December 2011 .
he served previously as a deputy prime minister and defence minister .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the KGB state security service , like Mr Putin .
in the late 1990s , when Mr Putin was head of the Federal Security Service ( FSB ) , which replaced the KGB , Mr Ivanov was appointed as his deputy .
when Mr Putin came to power , he named Mr Ivanov as one of the five people he trusted most .
it was once thought that Mr Ivanov might become president of Russia after Mr Putin &apos;s second term , as a third term for Mr Putin would have been unconstitutional .
but that post was taken by another close Putin ally , Dmitry Medvedev .
Mr Putin became prime minister , before returning to the presidency just three @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half years later .
mystery as fish land in Banff garden
a Banff man has appealed for help in identifying fish that have appeared in his garden in Banff .
Kevin Bain thinks the 75 fish could be sand eels deposited by a waterspout .
Mr Bain , who lives about 500m from the sea , posted footage of the spectacle on Periscope in the hope someone could shed light on the appearance of the two @-@ inch fish .
Queensferry Crossing : bridge now connected to Fife
the £ 1.35bn project is now due to be complete by May 2017
engineers have joined the Queensferry Crossing &apos;s north deck and viaduct - meaning the bridge is now connected to Fife .
it is the first of four closures between the &quot; deck fans , &quot; which are now nearing completion around each of the bridge &apos;s three towers .
the bridge section from Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tonnes .
it has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tonnes of concrete and 46 stay @-@ cables .
the £ 1.35bn project is now due to be complete by May 2017 .
economy Secretary Keith Brown visited the site today and was among the first to walk from the land on to the bridge .
he said : &quot; this is a historic and symbolic moment in the building of the Queensferry Crossing .
we &apos;re all witnessing engineering on a truly epic scale on this project , with over 30,000 tonnes of concrete and steel used just to build this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge completing the closure between the viaduct and bridge deck is a delicate operation involving extremely precise tolerances for fit up .
overall , nearly 79 % of the total bridge deck is now in place , the final section of deck is having its concrete deck cast in Rosyth today , meaning all the deck is ready to be lifted into place on the bridge .
Michael Martin , Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors project director said : &quot; the first closure on any bridge project is always a significant milestone .
on this fantastic project , this closure represents leading edge civil engineering .
after installing the last road deck section and connecting it to the expanding North Tower road deck , we then had to close the remaining gap on the north - or landward - side .
this was done by pulling the northern approach viaduct 700 millimetres southwards .
this was a massive and , at the same time , very delicate operation .
massive because the viaduct is 222 metres long , weighs approximately 6,000 tonnes and had to be pulled up a gradient of about 3 % .
delicate because the tolerances the team were working to were tiny - just a few millimetres either way .
happily , it all went very well .
Simone Biles nails all @-@ around gold in women &apos;s gymnastics
forget the pressure .
forget the hype .
Simone Biles is immune to all of it .
dynamic on vault .
effortless on beam .
jaw @-@ dropping on floor .
brilliant all over .
and now , finally , an Olympic champion .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gymnast soared to the all @-@ around title on Thursday , putting the gap between herself and the rest of the world on full display under the Olympic spotlight .
her total of 62.198 was well clear of silver medalist and &quot; Final Five &quot; teammate Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina .
United States &apos; Simone Biles performs on the balance beam during the artistic gymnastics women &apos;s individual all @-@ around final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday .
Biles became the fourth straight American woman to win the all @-@ around title and fifth overall while cementing her reputation as the best of her generation and perhaps ever .
she burst into tears when her final total was posted and her long journey to this moment ended .
the achievement puts her in the same league as once @-@ in @-@ a @-@ generation athletes like Michael Phelps who have taken their sports to new heights :
Biles has spent the last three years dominating her sport , winning 15 world championship medals - including 10 gold - with routines so astonishing in their mix of ambition and precision that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called her &quot; the greatest gymnast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
one last test awaited in Brazil , a contest not so much between Biles and the rest of the field but between herself and the burden of oversized expectations .
anything less than heading back to her family &apos;s home in Spring , Texas , with a fistful of golds would be seen as a disappointment .
United States &apos; Simone Biles , left , and Aly Raisman embrace after winning gold and silver respectively for the artistic gymnastics women &apos;s individual all @-@ around final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday , Aug.
Biles earned the first one on Tuesday while serving as the exclamation point to retiring national team coordinator Martha Karolyi &apos;s going away party .
while Biles insisted she &apos;s never looked ahead during her long run at the top , that &apos;s not exactly true .
a portion of her floor exercise routine - the one that includes her signature tumbling pass - is set to Latin music that would fit right at home in the street right outside the Rio Olympic Arena .
it &apos;s not a coincidence .
the girl adopted by her grandparents as a toddler and discovered by coach Aimee Boorman &apos;s mother during a field trip to the gym where Boorman was coaching has become a force .
she hasn &apos;t lost an all @-@ around competition since the summer of 2013 , a winning streak that should go for as long as Biles wants it to .
though Mustafina took a small lead through two rotations , it was a mirage .
balance beam and floor exercise - where Biles is the defending world champion - lay in wait .
she went back in front with a 15.433 on beam - and capped it with a 15.933 on floor .
Raisman hugged her gently as they awaited the final score - a mere formality - and tears appeared around Biles &apos; glittery red , white and blue eyeliner when the vision she once wrote in a scrapbook became a reality .
Raisman &apos;s performance was a bit of revenge from four years ago , when she tied for third but lost the bronze to Mustafina on a tiebreaker .
this time , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team captain the Americans call &quot; grandma &quot; was well ahead .
she blew kisses to the crowd after her floor exercise , overcome by a comeback that at times seemed in doubt .
as for Biles , the 19 @-@ year @-@ old &apos;s viral tweet from earlier this week now carries a whole new meaning :
Mahaj Brown , 6 , &quot; riddled with bullets , &quot; survives Philadelphia shooting
police say a 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy has been shot in Philadelphia , marking the second shooting of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old in the city this week .
the child &apos;s grandparents identified him to CBS Philadelphia as Mahaj Brown .
the grandparents say Brown suffered multiple gunshot wounds , including in his groin , leg , arm and abdomen , but was awake when he was transported to the hospital .
&quot; he just took a lot , his little body was riddled with bullets , &quot; his grandmother Delores Melendez tells the station .
I just can &apos;t believe it .
the boy is listed in critical condition at a hospital and has undergone several surgeries .
family tells the station he is expected to recover .
he was set to start first grade at a local elementary school .
Brown was among four people shot in the Germantown section .
also shot were three men : two 29 @-@ year @-@ olds and one 32 @-@ year old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men was reported in critical condition ; the other two victims were listed in stable condition , according to CBS Philadelphia .
the child was found shot in the front seat of a car along with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old in critical condition , the station reports .
the other two victims were not in the car and police are investigating whether any of the wounded men could be a shooter .
investigators tells CBS Philadelphia it appears there was crossfire between multiple gunmen .
assault weapon @-@ style shell casings , traced to different assault style weapons , littered the scene .
it appears that this was definitely an ongoing battle .
there were casings in the street , on both sides of the sidewalk .
so it appears that there were multiple armed combatants out here and that they were actively engaged , &quot; Philadelphia police Captain Anthony Ginaldi told the station .
multiple houses and vehicles in the area were also struck .
no arrests have been made and police are reportedly reviewing surveillance video .
another 6 @-@ year @-@ old , a girl , was hit in her arm by a stray bullet Tuesday while playing in front of her home in the West Oak Lane neighborhood .
she is recovering , and police are still searching for a suspect .
why we need Simone , Gabby and Laurie
that &apos;s what I call this year &apos;s Women &apos;s Olympic Gymnastics Team and for more reasons than one .
first , I have been to every Summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA has never been so dominant .
and second : this team features three gymnasts , Simone Biles , Gabby Douglas and Lauren &quot; Laurie &quot; Hernandez , who have been inspiring so many young girls of color .
the make @-@ up of this team , rounded out by Aly Raisman , who is Jewish , and Madison Kocian , who is Catholic , is making everyone proud .
this team looks , finally , like America .
it also has solidified the black and Latina female presence at the top of this sport .
for the past four years , the number one female gymnast has been African @-@ American .
last year , Simone and Gabby were # 1 and # 2 .
this is powerful .
last Olympics , Gabby Douglas was a surprise Olympic champion , and America cheered .
now the world has been able to witness the incredible performances of three @-@ time World Champion Simone Biles , Douglas and Laurie Hernandez delivering the unexpected , yet masterful gymnastics routines .
on Thursday , Simone became the fourth straight American to win gold in the women &apos;s individual all @-@ around event .
and teammate Aly Raisman earned silver .
we are witnessing the top of the sport , but it does not look like this at gymnastics classes across the country .
Simone , Gabby and Laurie all took the same path as Aly and Madison to make the Olympic team .
they are the &quot; Final Five &quot; because the next Olympic gymnastics team will only have four gymnasts on the team , and this is Marta Karolyi &apos;s last year coaching .
but the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport , and gymnasts primarily train in private gymnastics clubs that are maintained by parents paying the cost of the training , facility , travel , uniforms , competition fees , hotel fees ( for the coaches and their gymnasts and families ) and the list goes on .
most of these gymnastics clubs are located in affluent suburban neighborhoods that can support the business .
these clubs are where the gymnasts get all of their training , and it &apos;s a costly and long @-@ term commitment for the gymnasts &apos; families .
Aimee Boorman , coach of Simone Biles , and Maggie Haney , coach of Laurie Hernandez , have both coached their athletes since they started in gymnastics .
we must bring more affordable and accessible gymnastics training to the communities of countless young girls who are inspired by Simone , Gabby and Laurie .
I founded my gymnastics foundation 20 years ago .
at my organizations , we have provided free and low @-@ cost gymnastics , based in Harlem , for over 15,000 urban youth ( primarily black and Hispanic ) and have trained national and international champions .
in September , we will be expanding to Detroit ( my hometown ) to provide high quality gymnastics to the youth that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport .
gymnastics develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body and hard work , discipline and determination for the mind .
this combination provides life @-@ long benefits for good health , success in school and work .
it is the inspiration of this team that will send thousands of young girls to take gymnastics and that is great .
to participate in sport is so important , especially for girls .
this is such an exciting time .
thank you Simone , Aly , Laurie , Gabby and Madison for that serious showcase of &quot; Girl Power &quot; in winning the Olympic team gold and for motivating so many young girls of all backgrounds to begin their path to be healthy , strong and successful young women .
junior doctors set to mount further strikes after rejecting Jeremy Hunt &apos;s proposal
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by agreeing to a reformed contract with British Medical Association officials , but 58 per cent of the 37,000 junior doctors who took part in a ballot had rejected it .
in July , Mr Hunt revealed plans to impose the contract saying the NHS was in &quot; no man &apos;s land &quot; and any further delay would be damaging for staff and patients .
the first junior doctors are moved onto the new contract , which includes changes to overnight and weekend working practices to improve care at unsociable hours .
Dr Ellen McCourt , the BMA &apos;s junior doctors &quot; committee chair , said in a statement last night : &quot; junior doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract , particularly that it will fuel the current workforce crisis , and that it fails to treat all doctors fairly . &quot;
with just eight weeks before the first group of doctors are moved onto the new contract , progress needs to be made and time is running out .
efforts by the BMA to resolve the dispute through talks have been met with an unwillingness to engage and , at times , deafening silence from the government .
this is despite a promise from Jeremy Hunt just last month that his door is always open .
&quot; Jeremy Hunt needs to act now , lift the imposition and address junior doctors &quot; concerns .
if he does not then junior doctors are clear that they are prepared to take further industrial action .
the last strike at the end of April saw the postponement of nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments as nurses and consultants were drafted in to provide cover for doctors on the picket line .
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by agreeing to a reformed contract with British Medical Association officials .
the BMA wants better weekend pay for the 54,000 junior doctors who would be subject of the contract .
Daniel Mortimer , chief executive of NHS Employers , called on junior doctors not to go ahead with any strikes .
Mr Mortimer said : &quot; industrial action achieves little or nothing , but places pressure on already stretched teams and services and causes worry , distress and disruption for patients , carers and their families . &quot;
over the last two months we have been talking with the Junior Doctors Committee and have , along with the Department of Health and others , responded positively to their concerns regarding the Guardian Role and whistleblowing .
employers were hopeful that the continued positive engagement on other important topics - such as deployment , flexibility in training , additional training for those returning from career breaks , costs of training , mutual recognition of syllabus , study leave and the gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious employers , Health Education England and the Department of Health were about honouring the agreements reached with the BMA in November , February and May .
the £ 2 @-@ a @-@ day drug that can cut heart attack threat
thousands of heart attack patients are to benefit from a £ 2 @-@ a @-@ day drug , after officials recommended it be given to more people for longer .
anti @-@ clotting drug ticagrelor slashes the risk of repeat attacks for people with heart disease .
the drug is already given for 12 months after a heart attack , reducing the risk of a stroke or another attack .
NHS watchdog NICE has advised that it should be given to people for four years , to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
but now NHS watchdog NICE has advised that it should be given to people for four years , to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
some 140,000 people have a heart attack in England every year , and a quarter of these go on to have another attack or a stroke .
heart attacks and strokes are caused by the build @-@ up of fatty material in artery walls to form a plaque .
if the plaque breaks apart it can cause a blood clot , blocking blood to the heart causing a heart attack .
and if the clot dislodges it can travel in the blood stream and block blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke .
people who have already have one attack are at a higher risk of having another .
ticagrelor , which is made by UK firm AstraZeneca and sold under the trade name Brilique , reduces this risk by making clots less likely .
the draft NICE guidance , published today , recommends that people be given 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months , followed by 60mg along with aspirin twice a day for another three years .
Professor Carole Longson , director at the NICE health technology evaluation centre , said : &quot; despite the availability of effective secondary prevention treatments , as many as a quarter of people who have had a heart attack go on to have another heart attack or stroke - often with devastating consequences . &quot;
fear of a recurrence can have a significant negative impact on a person &apos;s quality of life .
the evidence shows that ticagrelor , in combination with aspirin , is effective at reducing the risk of further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack .
in provisionally recommending ticagrelor we are pleased to be able to increase the treatment options available to the many thousands of people who stand to benefit from it .
because information on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor - particularly the risk of bleeding - beyond three years is limited , the draft guidance does not recommend treatment with it beyond that period .
PC culture let vote fraud in Muslim areas flourish
ex @-@ Tower Hamlets mayor Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year for corruption , prompting the government report
a culture of political correctness has led to a blind eye being turned to widespread voting fraud in Muslim communities , a devastating government report reveals today .
ex @-@ Cabinet minister Sir Eric Pickles lambasts the police , election watchdogs and town halls for ignoring evidence of electoral abuse because of &quot; over @-@ sensitivities about ethnicity and religion . &quot;
the former communities secretary , now the anti @-@ corruption tsar , said the intimidation of voters on religious grounds was so bad that police should be allowed to put cordons outside polling stations to protect frightened voters .
he recommends that voters should have to take ID to prove who they are when they vote .
currently , a voter merely has to state their name and address .
the report even suggests putting indelible ink on a person &apos;s fingers as they cast their ballot to prevent anyone being able to vote twice .
greater protection should be given to whistleblowers , Sir Eric says .
he calls for the Press to be given greater access to council papers and decisions taken by unofficial committees or working groups .
&quot; this is not solely to protect against electoral fraud , but to protect local government from the broader culture of corruption and financial fraud that goes hand in hand with it , &quot; he said .
the report was ordered by Downing Street in the wake of the Tower Hamlets voting scandal in East London .
last year a special election court ruled the sitting mayor , Lutfur Rahman , should be removed from office following a litany of corrupt and illegal practices .
the court found Rahman &quot; cynically perverted &quot; the religious feeling of his Muslim community and silenced his critics with accusations of racism and Islamophobia .
Rahman , it was said , &quot; ran his campaign on the basis that it was the religious duty of faithful Muslims to vote for him . &quot;
up to 300 votes were dubious or the result of personation , where a person votes while posing as someone else .
sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud across the country .
he voiced particular alarm about postal voting fraud - in which senior members of the Muslim community were said to have exerted pressure on people to vote for a candidate of their choosing .
sir Eric , pictured , made several recommendations to clean up the voting system including bringing your ID to prove who you are
his report says : &quot; evidence was presented of pressure being put on vulnerable members of some ethnic minority communities , particularly women and young people , to vote according to the will of the elders , especially in communities of Pakistani and Bangladeshi background .
&quot; there were concerns that ... state institutions had turned a blind eye to such behaviour because of &quot; politically correct &quot; over @-@ sensitivities about ethnicity and religion . &quot;
sir Eric made 50 recommendations to clean up the system , including banning political activists from handling postal ballot papers to stop &quot; vote harvesting . &quot;
the report , being considered by Theresa May , also calls for tougher checks on registration to prevent the electoral register being used for immigration and benefit fraud .
consider the options for requiring voters to produce ID before voting .
use indelible ink on a person &apos;s fingers once they cast their ballot to prevent anyone voting twice .
carry out systematic checks on a person &apos;s nationality to ensure they are eligible to vote .
put a three @-@ year limit on requests for an automatic postal vote .
ban political campaigners and activists from handling completed postal votes and postal vote envelopes .
give police powers to set up cordons around polling stations .
change the law to make it easier to charge people with intimidation under the Representation of the People Act 1983 .
make it illegal to take pictures in polling stations .
make it a requirement that only English is to be used in polling stations ( except in Wales ) .
strengthen training to ensure staff enforce the rule that voters go to the booth alone .
sir Eric savages the Metropolitan Police , saying it is &quot; astonishing &quot; that no criminal charges were brought after the Tower Hamlets case .
&quot; the election court disqualified Lutfur Rahman and his agent for a litany of corrupt and illegal practices , &quot; he said .
he was found guilty beyond reasonable doubt - to a criminal standard of proof - on a series of grounds .
he also criticises the ineffectual &quot; tick @-@ box inspections &quot; of town hall electoral registration departments .
sir Eric said : &quot; last year &apos;s court ruling in Tower Hamlets was a wake @-@ up call .
our nation has a proud heritage as the mother of parliaments , yet the worrying and covert spread of electoral fraud and state of denial by some bodies threatens that good reputation .
crazy for Kate &apos;s cyclist lookalike and other celeb doppelgangers of Rio Olympians
fans of the Rio 2016 Olympics this week have gone wild for French cyclist Pauline Ferrand @-@ Prevot , who has proven an impressive lookalike for the Duchess of Cambridge .
but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olympian is far from the only athlete out fighting for gold this summer that boasts their own celebrity doppelganger - at least not according to social media .
so , in honor of the Rio Games and all the famous faces crossing our screens at the moment , FEMAIL have compiled a list of Olympians who bear more than a passing resemblance with Hollywood celebs .
the hunter and the wolf : U.S. Men &apos;s Archery Team member Brady Ellison , left , has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a kid
aside from Kate &apos;s doppelganger on the cycling track , many people online have been quick to point out how a certain archer could be the twin of A @-@ lister Leonardo DiCaprio .
U.S. Men &apos;s Archery Team member Brady Ellison has caused a storm on Twitter after images of him looking eerily similar to the Wolf of Wall Street star surfaced .
and in fact , the archer became aware of the social media frenzy and admitted that he has been hearing that he looks like Leo since he was a kid .
&apos;i personally don &apos;t see a huge resemblance , maybe besides the facial hair , &apos; Brady told Huffington Post .
&apos;he is a good @-@ looking dude so I guess it &apos;s a compliment.&apos;
one of the most popular comparisons from London 2012 is undoubtedly going to be pointed out even more this year : the striking likeness between British long jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris .
Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina , with her large , expressive eyes , has been said to be a dead ringer for Cuban @-@ American singer Gloria Estefan .
and over in the pool , South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been getting compared to Glee star Matthew Morrison for years now .
changing it up : this user reckons that Nathan is an &apos; athletic version &apos; of the Inception actor
another long @-@ running comparison has been between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett who boast a similar heavy brow and lips .
silver medal swimmer Russia &apos;s Yulia Efimova boasts more than just the same sunkissed skin and blonde hair as actress Annalynne McCord , while Team USA &apos;s Nathan Adrian has been said by fans to resemble an &apos; athletic version of Joseph Gorgon Levitt.&apos;
tough women : soccer star Hope Solo , left , and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter , right , have similar face shapes and eyes
not the only one : one Twitter user was very pleased that others also saw the similaritiest
floating a theory : according to this user , perhaps there is a reason behind the pair &apos;s similar looks
one Twitter user took to the site recently to declare her happiness that &apos; the rest of the internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are actually identical.&apos;
indeed , the USA soccer star and the Dexter actress share incredibly similar face shapes and eyes .
other popular comparisons have included Kerri Walsh @-@ Jennings and her smile that is near @-@ identical to that of actress Laura Linney , as well as gold medal @-@ winning gymnast Gabby Douglas , who boasts her own beautifully broad smile that matches that of Bring It On star Gabrielle Union .
CBC Olympics commentator apologizes for saying Chinese swimmer &apos; died like a pig&apos;
Byron MacDonald &apos;s analysis of 14 @-@ year @-@ old Ai Yanhan &apos;s fourth place finish at the women &apos;s 4x200m freestyle relay outraged viewers of CBC &apos;s live Olympic coverage on Wednesday
Canadian broadcaster CBC has been forced to apologize after one of its commentators said a 14 @-@ year @-@ old female Chinese swimmer &apos; went out like stink &apos; and &apos; died like a pig &apos; during a race .
commentator Byron MacDonald thought his mic was turned off when he started to dispense some of his own opinions at the end of the women &apos;s 4x200m freestyle relay final .
MacDonald , who was brought on board CBC &apos;s commentary team to provide &apos; color &apos; could be heard saying : &apos; that little 14 @-@ year @-@ old from China dropped the ball , baby &apos; .
too excited , went out like stink , died like a pig .
thanks for that .
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan , 14 , swam the second leg of the relay in 1 : 57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canada &apos;s Taylor Ruck , allowing the Canadians to close the gap on China .
viewers across Canada were quick to react online after being shocked by the tone and the language used
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted , &quot; Did the CBC announcer just say the 14 @-@ year @-@ old swimmer from China &apos; died like a pig &apos; &quot; ? ? ? ?
the idiot didn &apos;t realize they were still on the air.&apos;
AI Yanhan of China in the Women &apos;s 4 x 200m Freestyle Relay Final was described as : &apos; that little 14 @-@ year @-@ old from China dropped the ball , baby.&apos;
criticism on Twitter came thick and fast against Byron MacDonald with many calling him out
Twitter users did not hold back when the heard how insensitive Byron Macdonlad was being
another twitter user , Sarah Paradis , wrote : &apos; wow # ByronMacDonald .
you represent the CBC and Canada and make us all sound like a bunch of racists . # disgusted .
soon after , Scott Russel who was hosting CBC &apos;s broadcast apologized on @-@ air for MacDonald &apos;s comment , saying : &apos; we apologize the comment on a swim performance made it to air.&apos;
it was an unfortunate choice of words , we &apos;re sorry it happened.&apos;
CBC ended up apologizing more than 90 times to people who had tweeted in response to the remark
fellow commentator , Scott Russel , had to make an apology on MacDonald &apos;s behalf
CBC then copied and pasted their apology to more than 90 other twitter users who complained about MacDonald &apos;s comments
the network was also quick to apologize and released a statement .
we sincerely regret that these statements were made , and that they were allowed to go to air .
we moved quickly last night to apologize to our viewers on @-@ air and to our followers on Social media .
to be clear , Byron &apos;s comments were related to the swimmer &apos;s performance , not to her as an individual .
that said , they were inappropriate and an unfortunate choice of words and Byron is very sorry for what he said .
on Thursday afternoon , MacDonald apologized on @-@ air and attempted to qualify his remark by stating he didn &apos;t mean for it to be construed as a personal attack .
&apos;i would like to take a moment to apologize for a comment that I made last night after the women &apos;s relay , &apos; he said on CBC &apos;s Olympic broadcast.&apos;
&apos;i was referring to a swimmer &apos;s performance , and not to them as a person.&apos;
&apos;Needless to say , there was no disrespect intended and I &apos;m very sorry.&apos;
Primark shopper outraged at woman who brazenly tried on underwear in the middle of the shop
shoppers didn &apos;t know where to look when a woman stripped off to try on knickers on the shop floor in the middle of a Primark .
to make it even worse , she sized up how she looked in them , peeled them off and put them back on the shelf .
she carried on browsing and eventually tried on four pairs of underwear at the store in Bouverie Place shopping centre , Folkestone .
the Primark store in Bouverie Place shopping centre , Folkestone , where the woman tried on knickers before putting them back on the shelf
a mother @-@ of @-@ two , Jenny Davidson , who was in the shop at the time , said after trying on the underwear the mystery woman &apos; got dressed again and walked out of the store without buying anything.&apos;
she said : &apos; people couldn &apos;t believe what they were seeing.&apos;
standing in the middle of the shop floor , she took a pair of knickers from the display , stripped off her own tights and pants and put them on .
&apos;she didn &apos;t try to find anywhere discreet to do it - she just stood there , bold as brass.&apos;
&apos;everyone was staring as she took the knickers off again and obviously didn &apos;t like them because she put them back on the shelf.&apos;
she did the same with three more pairs before finally deciding there was nothing she liked and she got dressed again and walked out .
&apos;she didn &apos;t seem to care who was watching - or think about the person who would eventually buy the knickers she &apos;d been trying on.&apos;
Ms Davidson , 33 , who lives in the Kent town , said : &apos; how disgusting to think someone is going to take home knickers that another person has been wearing and they haven &apos;t been cleaned.&apos;
the incident happened on Tuesday afternoon .
Ms Davidson added : &apos; I gather the staff apparently tried to remove the garments from sale after she had left - which is just as well.&apos;
&apos;i &apos;d hate to get home with a new pair of knickers and find another woman had put them on and taken them off again , and they hadn &apos;t been washed.&apos;
a Primark spokesman said : &apos; Primark is aware of an incident which took place in our Folkestone store on Tuesday August 9.&apos;
all the product in question has been removed from sale .
how to defend yourself from gun attacks using Krav Maga
it &apos;s a dangerous world out there , but this video from Dailymail.com might help make it a little safer for you .
we spoke to Rhon Mizrachi , New York @-@ based grandmaster of the Krav Maga Federation , to find out how to deal with gun @-@ toting muggers at close range .
whether you &apos;re approached from in front or behind , this video will show you how to turn the tables on your mugger .
if approached from behind , Mizrachi says , the first thing to do is turn around , so that you can see your attacker and &apos; clear the line of fire &apos; .
you then grasp the gun between your forearm and shoulder before hitting them in the face with your free elbow .
a knee to the groin follows , and while the attacker doubles up in pain , you twist the gun from his hands , smack him in the face with the barrel and back up , keeping the weapon trained on him .
for gunmen approaching from the front , it &apos;s a similar technique - get your body out of the line of fire , grab the gun and twist it around so the villain can &apos;t fire .
at the same time , put weight on the gun and punch the attacker in the chest , then twist the gun from his grip before backing up and pointing it at him .
sounds tricky ?
check the video to see exactly how Mizrachi does it .
but remember that the safest way out of any mugging - if you &apos;re not a Krav Maga grandmaster - is to hand over your cash .
family of yobs destroyed Saltash , Cornwall council house ahead of eviction
a family of yobs left their council house with £ 50,000 worth of damage after they were evicted for terrorising their neighbours .
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock have been kicked out of the property in Saltash , Cornwall , after a long list of complaints against them .
after they were forcibly removed from the property , shocked housing associations officers found the property in a state of disrepair .
the walls were left with gaping holes , floorboards were ripped up , rubbish was strewn over the floor and graffiti was daubed on the walls .
the family have now been moved on and are believed to be living in a private accomodation
Donna McEvoy , housing manager at Cornwall Housing , said she feared it might be beyond saving .
she said : &apos; it &apos;s been an absolute nightmare for people down here and I don &apos;t think people should have to live like that .
there are a lot of things to weigh up because this property will probably be known by the not @-@ so @-@ nice element of Cornwall .
this family are notorious and their name is notorious .
the couple had three sons who lived at the property intermittently and police say the reign of terror the family inflicted included fighting in the street with baseball bats , intimidating nearby residents , drug use , drug dealing and excessive shouting , arguing and swearing .
Skeldon , 47 , whose name was on the tenancy , was given an antisocial behaviour order in June .
old rubbish was found in a number of the rooms of the house , which may be demolished
floor boards had been pulled up in the property , from which drugs had been dealt in the past
neighbours say they were seen fighting in the street and police were regularly called
Cornwall Housing evicted her and her partner forcefully from the property this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to move on voluntarily .
the eviction was hailed by relieved neighbours who said their lives had been made a living hell .
one said : &apos; they didn &apos;t care about anybody.&apos;
we lived next to them for 20 years and it &apos;s always been bad .
the amount of times we &apos;ve seen the police down here is unbelievable .
&apos;this morning , we couldn &apos;t sleep.&apos;
we got up because it was so quiet here - we &apos;re not used to that !
it &apos;s going to be lovely now that they &apos;re finally gone .
Adam Fitzpatrick , Cornwall Housing &apos;s neighbourhood enforcement manager , said the family failed to cooperate with the local authority .
the family have lived in the house for 20 years , with police regularly called to the property
rubbish and old toys have been thrown down the overgrown side of the council house
he added : &apos; it is a shame that the tenant failed to accept any responsibility for the behaviour of her and her family as eviction is always the last course of action that Cornwall Housing considers .
this was a very difficult case as the behaviour was extreme and their actions must have been terrifying for her neighbours to witness .
I appreciate all the work that has been put in by my team , Devon and Cornwall Police and members of the community who bravely came forward to give us information .
I hope that this development will give some comfort to the neighbours and sends out a message that antisocial behaviour will not be tolerated .
Mr Fitzpatrick said that the three sons had all lived at the property at different times but said they were all in their 20s .
a dirty mattress left on the floor of one of the bedrooms in the house after the eviction
housing workers will now have to clear away the piles of rubbish which surround the house
in 2014 , police raided the property and found more than 70g in cannabis as well as scales , paraphernalia and £ 1,700 in cash .
Skeldon was fined after pleading guilty to possession of a Class B drug with intent to supply .
she claimed the money was going towards a headstone for her son , Lee Skeldon , who died in a car crash in 2013 .
after being made homeless , it is understood that Tanya and her partner are now living in private housing in Plymouth .
the walls of many of the house &apos;s rooms had graffiti scrawled across them .
police say they will seek to evict tenants who flout the rules of their tenancies
Angela Crow , of Devon and Cornwall Police , said the eviction sent a clear warning to other tenants who continue to flout the rules .
&apos;this sends out to those who feel that they can behave without recrimination , as well as those blighted by such behaviour , &apos; she said .
criminal and antisocial behaviour will never be tolerated by Devon and Cornwall Police , who will continue to work with partners to protect our communities .
Reid says Clinton will stick with Garland as Supreme Court nominee if elected
Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid says he is convinced that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will nominate Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if she is elected president .
Senate Republicans have blocked Garland &apos;s confirmation since President Barack Obama nominated him in March .
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says the next president will choose the person to replace late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia .
Reid said on a conference call Thursday that he is predicting Clinton will pick Garland &quot; with some degree of credibility . &quot;
a spokeswoman for Reid later said he had not spoken to Clinton directly about whether she would nominate Garland and was speculating .
he praised Garland and said Clinton &apos;s team would not want to &quot; rock the boat &quot; with a new pick .
garland is the chief judge for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit .
Reid said Republicans who are blocking Garland &apos;s nomination are &quot; minions &quot; and &quot; enablers &quot; of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump .
he said Trump is unfit for office .

I do this for women .
apparently he thinks the calendar is , too .
&quot; we need to get back to showcasing timeless and classic nudity where women , as well as men , feel comfortable and inspired by these images of the female body , &quot; Shaw said in a press release announcing the calendar .
women will want to be a part of this project because it &apos;s a beautiful piece of art .

French court rejects bid to demolish shops at Jungle refugee camp
a French court has rejected a bid by Calais authorities to demolish dozens of makeshift shops and restaurants in the Jungle camp where thousands of refugees are living .
at a court hearing this week , Calais authorities had argued the state should be able to knock down a total of 72 makeshift shops where people inside the camp sell goods , from cigarettes to energy drinks , offer haircuts , or sell tea for 50 cents ( 40P ) or basic meals for a few euros in makeshift restaurants .
the Calais prefect &apos;s office argued the places should be demolished because they represented a parallel economy that did not pay tax , and because they carried fire and sanitation risks .
humanitarian groups had told the court the shops and restaurants were vital , saying the free meals offered by a state @-@ backed association and other groups did not provide enough food for the growing numbers at the camp .
they argued the makeshift shops and restaurants often provided shelter and free meals to those in need .
a Lille court ruled there was no legal basis for expelling the people running the 72 makeshift shops , but said the Calais prefect &apos;s concerns &quot; were totally understandable . &quot;
the judge , Jean @-@ François Molla , said the groceries , cafes and restaurants played a much bigger role than simply feeding people that &quot; live in extremely precarious conditions . &quot;
he said the spaces provided calm meeting points between refugees and volunteers .
one of the places that had been under threat from demolition was the camp &apos;s Jungle Book Kids &quot; Cafe which is run not @-@ for @-@ profit and provides 200 meals a day , English and French classes , and asylum advice for the hundreds of vulnerable unaccompanied minors in the camp .
more than 170,000 people have signed a petition to protect the kids &quot; cafe .
a letter sent to the Guardian said its closure &quot; would be a catastrophe for these children , some of whom are as young as eight . &quot;
two charities , Help Refugees and L &apos;Auberge des Migrants , on Friday estimated that numbers in the Jungle camp have risen to over 9,000 people - the highest ever - after a steep increase in arrivals during the summer .
&quot; this 5,000 @-@ yuan subsidy solved the problem of my pressing need for money . &quot;
Zhou Fen , a girl who was registered in the poverty @-@ stricken file of MIPO Village , Changle Town , Huayuan County , received the letter of admission from University of South China .
when she was worried about the tuition , the county committee of the Communist Youth League offered she a 5000 @-@ yuan subsidy on August 9 .
recently , the related county government department has provided a subsidy totaled 2.838 million yuan to over 690 poverty @-@ stricken college students .
it also organized social fund @-@ raising for students who are extremely poor in financial status to help them accomplish their study .
this year , Huayuan County integrated more than RMB 18.5 million of educational funds and self @-@ raised more than RMB 2.5 million , which will be injected into the real @-@ name bank accounts of the corresponding students .
&quot; I thought my elder brother and I cannot afford the college study after my father passed away . it never occurred to me before the county government helped us so timely . &quot; she said gratefully .
as of August 8 , Huayuan County had raised more than 21 million yuan of various relief funds this first half year for 13,140 poverty @-@ stricken students .
all poverty @-@ stricken students of the county that should be supported have been supported financially .
according to the reporter on the scene , a large container truck shifted to the fast lane with the command of a traffic policeman . its container box fell down onto the green road , making a 2 cm deep pit on the road .
according to the Xinhua news agency , Australia &apos;s New South Wales government announced on the 11th day of the month that it will spend 200 million Australian dollars ( about 154 million US dollars ) to launch the biggest renovation on the famous Sydney Opera House since its establishment .
the New South Wales government said the renovation would not change the shell shape of the opera house .
the Sydney Opera House is one of Sydney &apos;s landmark buildings , designed by Danish architect Jorn Utzon and built in 1973 . it welcomes about 8 million visitors each year .
Rory Jeffes , general manager of the Sydney Symphony Orchestra , believes that the Sydney Opera House will make a &quot; turnaround &quot; via this renovation and become one of the world &apos;s concerts with the best sound effects .
non @-@ permanent residents who have lived in Beijing for more than six months and have a stable and legal employment or accommodation or conditions for continuous schooling in Beijing can apply for a residence permit .
recently , the launch of implementation details of &quot; Residence Permit Provisional Regulations &quot; indicates that the &quot; temporary residence permit &quot; will be upgraded to &quot; residence permit . &quot;
a responsible person of the relevant department said that the transition from the &quot; temporary residence permit &quot; to &quot; residence permit &quot; means that Beijing will shift its administration for non @-@ permanent residents from the &quot; management &quot; to multi @-@ directional services .
today , a reporter learned from the State Administration of Taxation ( SAT ) that as of the end of June this year , the tax authorities at all levels have announced a total of 2,470 illegal &quot; blacklist &quot; cases .
it is understood that in July 2014 , SAT took the first step in the central government departments to issue an Information Disclosure Methods For Major Tax Violations along with the Tax Credit Management Approach .
in addition to the illegal facts , legal basis , the handling and punishment of these cases , the basic information of the illegal parties and the relevant intermediaries will be included in the &quot; blacklist &quot; exposure .
quality inspection , treasury , customs and other government departments also take relevant disciplinary measures against the &quot; blacklist &quot; parties .
&quot; the credit repair mechanism is an important milestone in the construction of the tax credit system and even the credit system of the whole society , which indicates that the construction of our social credit system is becoming more and more mature . &quot;
&quot; environmental problems are embodied by the atmosphere , water and soil pollution , but the root still lies in the mode of production and living . &quot;
for example , the land development ratio of Jiangsu Province was up to 21 % in 2015 , ranking top among all provinces and autonomous regions of China .
therefore , the problem of high pollution , heavy energy consumption and land occupation has not been fundamentally addressed in the transformation of production and life styles .
on the one hand , Jiangsu tops in the whole country from the perspective of the establishment achievement of ecological environment of all levels and classes . but on the other hand , the resource and environment pressure is heavy .
to solidly promote the ecological environment protection and governance , we need to fundamentally promote the transformation of production and lifestyle and promote the transformation of people &apos;s livelihood from the perspective of ecological civilization construction .
on the 11th day of the month , 42 wind turbine blades produced by Guodian Group was prepared to be shipped and exported to South Africa from the wharf of Lianyungang Port .
since last year , Guodian Group has exported a total of 163 sets of wind power projects from Lianyungang Port to South Africa .
the third party company ( non @-@ Chinese company ) commissioned by the Olympic Organizing Committee is located in the Sao Paulo state , Brazil , about 75 kilometers away from the city of Sao Paulo .

after overtime work of 30 hours , the manufacturer finally completed the Chinese flag production and loaded for transportation . the task was finished 4 @-@ 5 working days in advance .
it is reported that the flags are expected to arrive in Rio on the 11th . then the Olympic Organizing Committee will send the flags to various Olympic venues after receiving the flag . the whole process will be under the supervision of the Chinese embassy in Brazil .
( this newspaper ) On the 10th day of the month , the Nantong Municipal Government held a series of cooperation activities at the Shanghai International Convention Center . more than 180 Shanghai enterprises were invited to participate . more than 20 Hu @-@ Tong industry docking projects worth at least RMB 100 million saw on @-@ site signing .
the 20 projects with simultaneous signing have a total investment of RMB 8.063 billion , involving new energy , new materials , modern services and other industries .
Qingdao is China &apos;s 12th and also Shandong &apos;s first trial city to use and trade emissions .
on the 11th day of the month , many companies came to the Qingdao Municipal Emissions Trading Center to submit emissions subscription . after acceptance , they shall pay fees .
the upcoming first single transaction also indicates that Qingdao emissions trading pilot officially kicked off . it will also be the first emissions trading in Shandong and the first city @-@ level emissions trading in China .
in the morning of 11th day of the month , Zhao Xiuping , the General Manager of Qingdao Shuangtao Fine Chemical ( Group ) Co . , Ltd. came to the trading center to submit emissions subscription .
its plant in the old urban area of Qingdao came to a full halt and was moved to the new plant in Pingdu due to environmental reason .
after Zhao Xiuping submitted the application form and the construction project environmental impact report , etc . , Qingdao Municipal Emissions Reserve and Trading Service Center began to review the application materials .
according to the collection standard determined by Qingdao price bureau and financial sector , the estimated initial emission fee is about 641,200 yuan . the working staff will finish review within 7 working days .
the upcoming first single transaction also indicates that Qingdao emissions trading pilot will officially kick off . it will also be the first emissions trading in Shandong and the first city @-@ level emissions trading in China .
according to Zhao Xiuping , up to RMB 400 million has been invested in the current environmental protection . such investment has a great impact on the enterprise management philosophy and social benefits and also opened up a space for the enterprise innovation management .
on the same day , Qingdao SF @-@ XC @-@ ZZ Coach Component Co . , Ltd. also came to purchase emission rights for its project with an annual output of 4,200 interior accessories of high @-@ speed rail and CRH .
the project is a mechanical processing enterprise . its initial emission rate for the chemical oxygen demand ( COD ) and ammonia ( NOX ) are 0.514 tons / year and 0.052 tons / year , respectively .
the paid use and trading of Air Pollutant Emission Permits cover the city &apos;s key industrial enterprises for the production and supply of electricity and heat .
on January 1 , 2016 , the current pollutant discharging unit which obtained environmental impact assessment shall be exempt from expenditure of compensated use .
the obtaining of compensated emission right is not equal to the obtaining of illegal discharge , so companies cannot discharge pollutants at will .
Han Hongyan , deputy director of Qingdao Environmental Protection Bureau , introduces that companies of illegal and excessive sewage must be punished in accordance with the relevant laws and regulations . illegal enterprises cannot be allowed to circumvent punishment via purchasing emission rights .
in other words , we need to crack down on environmental violations through legal means and severely punish the enterprises &apos; over standard discharge behaviors , so as to protect the environment and public health .
now for their own interests , enterprises have raised their enthusiasm of pollution control , cherished limited emissions and reduced emissions of pollutants .
with the economic interests drive , to reduce pollutants &apos; discharge has shifted from the government &apos;s mandatory behavior into a conscious market behavior , so as to truly protect the environment , nature and public health .
emission right , also known as &quot; dumping right , &quot; means the right to discharge pollutants . it refers to the right for emitters to discharge pollutants to the environment in line with the law within the quota assigned by the government .
this right is essentially the right of the emitters to occupy , use and benefit from environmental capacity resources .
next , under the premise that the total discharge of pollutants does not exceed the total allowable emission volume , the internal resources of pollution began to swap discharge capacities via currency exchange .
since the proposition of emissions trading by American economist Dyers in 1968 , it has been applied by the United States of America to the management of atmospheric and river pollution sources since the 1970s .
since its pilot in China in 2007 , it has been applied to 14 provinces ( autonomous regions and municipalities ) including Zhejiang and Jiangsu .
according to the Ministry of Defense of Russia , in order to assist the air attack of the six strategic bombers on the &quot; Islamic State &quot; target in Syria , a number of Russian fighters lifted from the Syrian Mahmir Air Force base to provide support .
on February 22 this year , the United States and Russia reached a ceasefire agreement on the Syrian conflict . the ceasefire agreement will be implemented since February 27 .
under the agreement , the ceasefire does not include a military strike against terrorist organizations including &quot; Islamic State &quot; and &quot; Salvation Front , &quot; which were identified by the United Nation Security Council .
Russia will continue to build the relevant military infrastructure in the base and the living conditions of the Russian soldiers will be protected correspondingly .
he also said that if the extremist forces were not hit , these forces will be extended to Russia .
although Russia and the West did not reach an agreement on the cooperation against the extremist forces of Syria , Russia would strengthen cooperation with Syria , Iran and Iraq in this regard .
in September 2015 , Russia , at the invitation of the Syrian government , began a military strike against Syrian extremist forces .
on March 15 this year , Russia &apos;s major military forces began to evacuate , but the Russian side promised to continue to retain the military base in Heimi Mimi and the naval base in Tartus .
in the case of renovating old houses and successful startup in his hometown , He Peijun is making a good example : to inherit a 100 @-@ year old house and tell a story about the land heritage .
today , 100,000 people on average visit Zhushan each year , bringing a variety of ideas or seeking inner peace .
in fact , the relationship between the village and the city should companionship with , just like mother and child . no matter strong or weak . there is no need for any party to be governed by the other party . such a relationship is warm .
there is no fixed pattern of rural development , but it is quite difficult to just rely on spontaneous rural changes . one of the most important changes is to let the right people go to villages .
Shanghai Songjiang District Traffic Control Department recently used electronic police to monitor whether the driver plays mobile phone while driving . as a result , more than 30 cases were detected in a week .
with the popularity of smart phones , mobile phones become more and more funny . WeChat , microblogging and even games , shopping on Taobao have become normal . it seems that many people cannot leave the phone for a moment , and cannot stop even when driving .
according to &quot; Road Traffic Safety Act , &quot; mobile phones playing are banned and defined as &quot; behavior preventing safe driving . &quot;
unfortunately , due to some reasons such as the large number of illegal cases and difficulty in obtaining evidences , those people have never been punished and make the laws become a kind of decoration .
if the traffic control department can be determined to declare war to the mobile phone playing behavior while driving and normalize such measures , such illegal behaviors will surely be curbed .
the public security organ shall be strict with household registration management by gradually establishing electronic and paper files for people without Hukou ( household registration ) and ensure the completeness and validity .

in the collective greenhouse of Donglin village of Taicang City , the 48 @-@ year @-@ old Wang Xuefen is leading workers to pear spray pesticides on pear trees .
there are 150 acres of orchards and more than 10 species , but only 12 workers plus a technical engineer are ok .
last year , the income was a total of RMB 50,000 . I cannot earn so many if i work in the factory because of such age .
last year , the income of Donglin village reached RMB 22 million , of which total agricultural income accounted for nearly a half .
according to Su Qifang , the village secretary , per capita land cultivation area increases each year . 50 mu ( a unit of area , one &quot; mu &quot; = 0.0667 hectares ) in the beginning and over 100 mu now . the revenue per mu increases every year and the income of professional farmers also have room for growth every year .
with shares quantifying to each villager , the highlight of the rural collective economic reform is to be clear about the property rights of rural collective management and exploring political and economic separation .
in July 2015 , on Anzhen Street of Wuxi Xishan District , 14 rural economic cooperation organizations worked with the village committee to implement &quot; sub @-@ account management . &quot; the village committee implemented rural public affairs management while the cooperative organizations were mainly engaged in business .
with two accounts for two institutions , this can prevent the village cadres from participating in collective asset management corruption .
Zhu Baoping , deputy director of the Jiangsu Provincial Agriculture Committee , said that the next step of Jiangsu government is to continue to promote the reform of community cooperation system , encourage farmers to jointly develop and establish a village @-@ level democratic power operation mechanism .

Xiamen girl Zhang Binbin : &quot; handsome hands &quot; encourage her to start shooting career , which saw several &quot; reverse &quot;
Zhang Donghong , a villager of the East Park Village , Xiamen Xiang &apos;an District , changed his 29 @-@ inch old TV into a 65 @-@ inch TV just a few days before .
the ordinary farmer has a daughter , named Zhang Binbin . she is the one to win Sanzi final silver medal of Olympic Games Women &apos;s 50 @-@ meters rifle games for China in the evening of the eleventh .
in the evening of the 11th day of the month , just in front of this new TV set , the Zhang Donghong couple and their dozens of relatives and friends have witnessed the magic process for the couple &apos;s daughter to catch up and reverse from almost being eliminated in the preliminaries to almost winning .
at the game , Zhang Binbin was ranked in the middle and lower reaches and it seemed she was still quite far away from the final .
but her parents and friends did not give up , kept watching the live and saw other players finish the game . Zhang Binbin raised her ranks all the way and finally came to the final . at this time , a burst of cheers broke out in her home .
in the final , Zhang Binbin also started from lagging behind and shot more stably and won the silver medal with just 0.2 rings behind the champion .
this year , the 27 @-@ year @-@ old Zhang Binbin , in the 16 @-@ year shooting career , has actually missed the silver medal for several times .
according to her mother Zhang Xiaolong , her daughter sent a few &quot; little persuaders &quot; from her village at their hesitation .
these little persuaders are girls and boys of her village who were recommended to attend the training at the same time , including Zhang Binbin &apos;s cousin .
just after coming to Xiamen team , Zhang Binbin once again took the initiative to return to Xiang &apos;an school because of her family difficulties .
but after the repeated efforts of her enlightening teacher , Zhang Binbin returned to Xiamen team .
and after she came into the provincial team , Zhang Binbin returned home because she found it almost hopeless to enter the national team after a long time .
this time , not only the coach Zhang Yajie , but also the leaders and coach of Xiamen shooting archery sports center and Fujian provincial team came to her home . with their efforts , Zhang Binbin was finally persuaded to return to the provincial team .
just at yesterday &apos;s game , the Xiamen girl achieved several reversals of the shooting with her insistence .
&quot; each coach has his own method to choose the potential player . I decided to take her once I saw her beautiful hands . &quot;
Zhang Donghong also recalled , in the training test , although the results of her daughter were not the best , her rings were very stable , which is also an important reason for Zhang Binbin to attract coaches .
during the training process of Zhang Binbin , it was the input of this farmer girl that impressed Zhang Yajie most .
he recalled that after Zhang Binbin came into the Xiamen shooting team more than a year later , the team carried out a long shot of gun training , requiring players not to move for half an hour .
Zhang Xiaolong told reporters that her daughter has always been a quiet and well @-@ behaved child , with the hobby of painting and producing toys .
&quot; I used to make clothes and do some sowing jobs . Binbin picked up some scraps to make her own dolls . &quot;
she said , her daughter often sewed hand toys . plus , she is good at painting and could make animated toys from the doll &apos;s facial features to clothing .
as an athlete , Zhang Binbin and her family are separate more than being together . as she can only return home during festivities , she mainly contacts family members by phone in other time .
according to her parents , no matter meeting in person or talking by phone , Zhang Binbin seldom talked about her hard work but more about some happy things .
because they cannot often see their daughter , they put away the paintings of her childhood and honors of consecutive years .
Zhang Xiaolong showed the animation show of her daughter to the reporter , &quot; She should keep drawing instead if she did not become shooter . &quot;
in the living room on the second floor of Zhang Binbin , there was a cupboard filled with medals and certificates .
Zhang Donghong put away the medals neatly and placed all certificates into files for storage . &quot; this is honor made by Binbin after a dozen of years &apos; efforts . we feel quite cherished . &quot;
recently , Hebei Cixiao Fund sent a 16,000 @-@ yuan relief sent to six families who lost their relatives in Xiaozuo , Taitou and Guiquan Village of Jinjing County .

according to a Hong Kong Oriental Daily report made on August 12 , the current diamond sales in Mainland China were accused of three major problems , including the false marking of diamond clarity to raise sales price , false diamond weight and unguaranteed aftersales , etc .
Antwerp is one of the world &apos;s largest diamond trading centers . the diamond cutting technology of local artisans is well @-@ known . all diamonds on sale have undergone rigorous identification , deeply welcomed by the mainland ladies .
&quot; a small cloth bag , holding in one &apos;s hand , such light @-@ weighted , is worth of almost one million yuan , &quot; a woman surnamed Liu who participated in the purchase of diamonds told of her experience in Antwerp last June to the mainland media .
she buried the diamond in her lingerie and carried it all day along , including when she went to toilet and took bath .
she said the diamond she bought in Antwerp was priced about RMB 55,000 per gram and diamond of the same quality was retail @-@ priced about RMB 111,000 in Xia &apos;men .
recently , she sold the diamond with 120 % more than the price she bought and earned two hundred thousand yuan .
according to the provisions of the Mainland Customs , diamonds are neither supplies nor necessities during the trip and thus belong to the scope of goods . so such diamond should be declared at entry and exit . otherwise , it shall be classified as smuggling . people may be sentenced to jail .
according to foreign media reports , on the 10th day of the month of the local time , the British Prime Minister &apos;s Downing Street announced that British Prime Minister Teresa Mei will go to Switzerland to spend the summer vacation , but did not disclose the specific place .
according to some media , after the British referendum off Europe , the new British Prime Minister chose to spend her vacation on the &quot; neutral country , &quot; Swiss on the European continent . this is symbolic .
the British &quot; Guardian &quot; commented that the symbolic neutrality nature of the Swiss played a role in the choice of the British Prime Minister &apos;s first resort .
British &quot; Daily Telegraph &quot; commented that Teresa Mei chose to take a vacation in Switzerland . this is the first time that the British Prime Minister chose to go vacation in Swiss after Margaret Thatcher .
the choice of these two female prime ministers is quite a contrast to the hot place which Blair and Cameron , the two male prime ministers like to go to .
it is reported that the new British Prime Minister Teresa Mei will return to London on August 24 . a series of important work and activities will be waiting for her .
the British parliament will resume on September 5 . the subject matter covers the second Brexit referendum required by the internet .
on June 23 , the British held a referendum for Brexit , but the British new prime minister did not want to start the article 50 , which is involved with the Lisbon Treaty before the end of the year .
there are 1,325 existing intangible cultural heritage projects in Huangshan . its number and quantity ranked first in Anhui province .

China &apos;s Mars program is coming
China Mars exploration mission aims to achieve surrounding , landing and patrolling at one time , which has never occurred in foreign countries .
China &apos;s Mars exploration launch target is to step around , land and patrol at one time . such task has considerable difficulty .
because the Mars probe can encounter a time window in 26 months , experts are closely working on the project plan and try to launch the first Mars probe in 2020 .
according to Xu Dazhe , although China &apos;s aircraft has entered a deep space , it is still essential to finish the task of Mars exploration . the detection of Mars means that China has stepped into the deep space exploration era in a true sense .
&quot; every two or three years , there is a chance that Mars is closest to Earth . and at this point , it is most energy efficient to launch the vehicle . &quot;
&quot; taking into account the mass of Mars detectors , it will be the job of China &apos;s Long March 5 carrier rocket to complete the launch mission . &quot;
China &apos;s Mars exploration mission aims to achieve surrounding , landing and patrolling at one time , which has never occurred in foreign countries . there was one time of surrounding and landing before in foreign countries , but the landing failed .
Mars exploration involves a lot of technical areas . in particular , although the rover is a space detector , it has a distinctive feature compared with the general space detector .
in other words , the Mars probe should be capable of determining the driving route and equipped with the ability to find obstacles .
according to Pang Zhihao , a researcher of the fifth institute of China &apos;s Aerospace Science and Technology Group , the reason for human being to favor Mars exploration is because Mars detection has significant scientific and technical meanings and it even matters to the future of human beings .
currently , the Mars has become the planet with the highest degree of human research . the history of human beings to use space detectors for Mars exploration almost goes across the entire history of human space exploration .
therefore , the human beings hope that one day on the Mars to establish a base of residence , and ultimately to Mars immigration , it turned into a second home of mankind .
a large number of signs also show that the Mars is likely to be the same as the current Earth , only after billions of years of evolution into the atmosphere thin , low temperature , water depletion and so on .
therefore , the detection or manned landing on the Mars for research can help propose a pre @-@ arranged planning to prevent the earth from becoming the second Mars which is difficult for human beings to inhabit .
as of June 2016 , the world conducted a total of 114 lunar explorations , including 43 Mars detection missions .
however , ever since the 1990s , a total of 18 human explorations have been carried out and only 14 lunar detections have been conducted .
there are currently five Mars orbiters and two Mars rovers at work , but only one lunar orbiter and one lunar lander are at work .
world space powers have developed a detection plan with the Mars system as target . so we can see the current Mars detection is hotter than that of moon detection .
on Nov. 5 , 2013 , India launched the first Mars probe &quot; Mangalian , &quot; and has become Asia &apos;s first country for successful detection of the Mars .
&quot; Mangalian &quot; is used to study the surface , the atmosphere and mineral characteristics of the Mars and explore whether there are signs of methane and life on the Mars .
the hardest part of the mission is that the probe just has one chance before entering the Martian atmosphere for aerodynamic shape and parachute deceleration .
according to Sun Zezhou , the chief designer of a Mars detector of the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation , the Mars exploration task is confronted with many technical challenges .
the atmospheric pressure of the Mars is very low , only 1 % of the Earth &apos;s surface atmospheric pressure , with high uncertainty .
scientists have not had a thorough understanding of Mars factors such as its changes and storm characteristics .
a dust storm similar to the Earth &apos;s dust is often formed in the Mars in the summer , which will lead to a sharp decline in solar energy . so a &quot; sleep &quot; mode must be designed for the Mars rover and let it wait patiently until the disappearance of dust storms .
at the same time , the Martian atmosphere has a reducing effect on sunlight , which poses a problem for the energy supply for Mars detection .
this requires that the detector &apos;s sun wing area to be larger , and need to constantly adjust , and strive to align with the sun direction .
in addition , since the gravity of the Mars is only 38 % of that of the earth and much higher than that of the Moon surface , so the probe requires higher power .
&quot; the core and the most difficult part of the Mars exploration mission are the aerodynamic shape and parachute deceleration process after the probe enters Martian atmosphere . there is just one chance to ensure success . &quot;
according to Sun Ze , it must rely on the detector to complete the entire process because the distance between the Earth and the Mars is quite large .
because there is not so much propellant to offset the high speed , the slowdown should rely on the atmosphere of the Mars while landing the Mars . however , it is quite difficult to simulate the atmosphere of the Mars on earth .
Pang Zhihao said , in general , the way to detect the Mars is similar to the way to detect the moon . the entire process is also &quot; surrounding , landing , patrolling and returning &quot; to achieve the goal of manned landing on the Mars .
because the distance between the Mars and the earth is larger than that between the Moon and Earth , it needs to overcome a series of more complex technical difficulties before the Mars detection .
according to Taiwanese media reports , Lin Quan , the head of Taiwan &apos;s Executive Yuan , announced yesterday morning , &quot; Ill @-@ gotten Party Assets Handling Regulations by political parties and their accompanying organizations &quot; will take effective since today .
KMT Vice Chairman Zhan Qixian said , &quot; Kuomintang , with a hundred years of history , will step down otherwise without social commitment and responsibility . &quot;
Lin Quan stressed that if the political party , accompanying organization or trustees are in violations of the regulations which prohibit provisions ban , the Commission will investigate and punish &quot; according to the law . &quot;
Lin Quan also announced that Hong Peigen , &quot; Deputy Director of the Independent , &quot; will serve as the vice chairman of the Ill @-@ gotten Party Assets Settlement Committee .
he said that Gu Lixiong will be the most appropriate candidate for the Ill @-@ gotten Party Assets Handling Regulations . the experience of Hong Peigen who dealt with the major cases will serve as the foundation for the committee to uncover the related Ill @-@ gotten Party Assets .
Zhan Qixian said that , as long as there are party assets today , no one will give you social donations . so if the party were all confiscated away , then Kuomintang can just ask for social support and sponsorship , &quot; You will have chance to go when there are no assets . &quot;
Zhan Qixian also stressed that even if the Ill @-@ gotten Party Assets Handling Regulations goes into effect and the Kuomintang party assets are not fully confiscated , the rest will continue to be confiscated as promised , the party asset will go null and the party will start from scratch .
original title : suit launched by &quot; corridor doctor &quot; Lan Yuefeng against CCTV host Wang Zhi &apos;an for reputation infringement fails in instance judgment
the legal evening news : because the CCTV host Wang Zhi &apos;an published his remarks against the &quot; corridor doctor &quot; event on microblogging , Lan Yuefeng brought Wang Zhi &apos;an and Beijing Micro Dream Chuangke Network Technology Co . , Ltd. to the court .
yesterday afternoon , Haidian court sentenced the case and the verdict said that Wang Zhi &apos;an and Micro Dream Company did not constitute the infringement and dismissed the Lan Yuefeng for all the claims .
at the beginning of 2014 , CCTV reporter Wang Zhi &apos;an found after his survey that although Lan Yuefeng was sitting in the corridor for more than 600 days and was shaped as the tragic hero suppressed by the media , these reports had a lot of false information .
on March 29 , 2014 , the &quot; corridor doctor &quot; program produced by CCTV news survey broadcasted .
all information about the so @-@ called over @-@ medical treatment reported by Lan Yuefeng to the media do not have any evidence support .
in the microblogging with real @-@ name certification , Wang Zhi &apos;an also said that the reason for Lan Yuefeng to become this is because of his stubborn characters and paranoid personality . &quot;
LAN Yuefeng claimed that Wang Zhi &apos;an should delete the microblogging and apologized to him and made compensation of 100,000 yuan for the mental damage solatium .
at the time of the trial , the two sides argued whether Wang Zhian violated the reputation right of Lan Yuefeng .
highlight of the 12th day of the month : at the beginning of Track and Field Events , the Chinese team is quite busy and the women &apos;s football association aims to become the top four of the bicycle games
the bicycle game is expected to realize the &quot; zero breakthrough &quot; in the Olympic gold medal while the Women &apos;s World Cup girls will challenge Germany team , the world champion winner for twice and are expected to become the top four .
Wang Zhen was quite outstanding in the two races . he won silver medal for the athletics world championship held in Beijing last year and was upgraded to the individual project champion in the world championship this May .
according to foreign media reports , Zhang Huizhen , the 27 @-@ year @-@ old Korean archery female player won the gold medal in the women &apos;s archery individual tournament . this is the second scoring of Olympic gold medal following the team competition . this made she become a double winner .
Zhang Huizhen is considered as a late bloomer . she regrets about not winning the last session of the London Olympic Games tickets before , but now she proudly stands on the top of the Rio Olympic podium .
Zhang Huizhen won the gold medal in Lisa Wenglu , a total score of 6 @-@ 2 in the women &apos;s archery finals at the Samba Boulevard in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil .
she did archery for the first time in the fourth grade of primary school . she won the first individual tournament gold medal when she was 27 in 2014 . so she is a late bloomer .
Zhang Huizhen recalled , &quot; My performance before high school was too bad to enable me to participate in the national competition .
Zhang Huizhen was ranked the fourth at the London Olympic Games qualification trials . unfortunately , she lost the Olympic admission and can just watch her colleague and good friend Qi Pubei score two gold medals .
Zhang Huizhen talked about his gold winning after the women &apos;s individual awards ceremony of archery . &quot; I tried to shoot one by one until the last . maybe it is because this brings me good results and makes me contented . &quot;
the 28 @-@ year @-@ old Korean archery &quot; No.1 , &quot; and the London Olympic Games archery individual tournament winner Qi Fubei won the bronze medal .
Qi Fubei was defeated by Zhang Huizhen in the semifinals and competed for the bronze medal with the Mexican player Alexandra Valencia .
Qi Fubei shed tears after she knew she won the blonde medal . at this time , we can know her pressure .
firstly , the coaching staff accumulated rich experience in his gradual study . secondly , it needs scientific training , which should be accumulated over time .
the Archery team helped the team players focus and remain unbiased via military training and going through the cemetery during night .
although not yet confirmed , it is said by many sources that Apple &apos;s 2016 autumn conference will be held in September , and iPhone7 would really be launched into the market .
although Apple did not respond , there are news release about the function and configuration of the new iPhone . there are even the images of iPhone7 &quot; real machine model &quot; on the internet .
the new generation of iPhone is really &quot; eye @-@ catching , &quot; hot and hard @-@ to @-@ get . if you want to buy the genuine product at the first time , you must choose a good channel , for example , Suning .
this has exacerbated people &apos;s disappointment of the new iPhone , &quot; It is lengthened , but cannot be used to cast holographic images ! this generation of iPhone is so terrible . &quot;
iPhone7 , just like other iPhones , brings countless secret before birth .
in addition , there are a number of sources claiming that the new generation of iPhone will have the 3.5mm headphone jack cancelled , and adopt Bluetooth connection and charging interface instead , which will provide space for Apple to add a second speaker .
another evidence to support this news is that as early as 2014 , Apple will allow headset manufacturers to produce headset products via producing charging interface .
another evidence to confirm this message is that Apple allows the headphone manufacturer to produce headphone via the connection of charge interface .
whether these news are true or false will not be unveiled until the 2016 Apple autumn conference .
but this does not prevent the industry insiders to be optimistic about the prospects of iPhone7 - many people think that iPhone7 will be likely to become the last major upgrade of Apple &apos;s iPhone series , although it can be seen from the data released by the market research institution IDC that the market share of iPhone will decline to some degree .
among them , Goldman Sachs ranked Apple &apos;s stock to be the rating of &quot; buying &quot; while BMO analyst thought that iPhone7 will obtain a historical high sales achievement .
meanwhile , Broadcom CEO Hock Tan also said that Apple &apos;s future revenue growth will likely be more than 20 % , which is entirely due to the introduction of iPhone7 .
7 % of respondents said they have the plan to buy iPhone7 , while only 4 % people had the plan to buy iPhone6 .
it is understood that currently 20 % of user groups of iPhone6 or 6Plus have such a plan to purchase iPhone7 . this is a quite high proportion .
secondly , according to expert analysis , most of the iPhone fans like to replace their own iPhone mobile phone .
according to statistics , among all iPhone users , about 26 % of users have not changed their phones for 2 years . that is , almost 120 million users of iPhones have been using the same iPhone for 2 years .
according to media , Taiwan witnessed several earthquakes during the production period of iPhone7 . &quot; the destruction of TSMC production facilities is beyond imagination and may impact the initial supply of iPhone7 . &quot;
supply and demand contradiction will affect the average user , so it is time to choose a good channel and purchase the genuine iPhone7 for the first time .
according to informed sources , recently , Suning executives and Apple frequently meet , with the purpose to prepare adequate supply .
operators have negotiated with Suning . so it is foreseeable that , with the depth of cooperation between the two sides , lower prices and more intimate services will inevitably bring to users .
&quot; with the lowest price , the consumer may &quot; buy iPhone7 with just 7 yuan per day . &quot;
adequate supply and a variety of concessions will alleviate the pressure of iPhone7 buying . Suning &apos;s logistics will change such good feeling into more intuitive sense of experience .
maybe you &apos;ll get a call at midnight . &quot; hello , Suning Tesco , your iPhone7 is here . &quot;
the organizers hope that the local people can understand more about the history of Chinese culture via the cultural relics exhibition , thereby enhancing the mutual understanding and friendship between the two peoples .
as part of the European tour , Barcelona &apos;s &quot; Ming Dynasty Heritage Exhibition &quot; will continue until early October .
yesterday , Huaxia Bank and Shanghai Pudong Development Bank issued a semi @-@ annual report of the year 2016 . in the second quarter , China Securities Finance Corporation Limited ( CSFC ) will once again buy their shares .
among them , CSFC will hold an additional 29.2931 million shares of Huaxia Bank . by the end of June , CSFC will increase its shares of Huaxia Bank to 387 million shares , raising its shares of Huaxia Bank from 3.35 % to 3.62 % .
according to the estimates of China Merchants Securities , deducted from the shares , CSFC will hold another 38 million shares of Pudong Development Bank in the second quarter and raise its shares to almost 600 million shares , which account for 2.77 % of the bank shares .
recently , Shizi Bang Hebo Park , Zhengfu village , Tongxiang City , Zhejiang province will be open to villagers and tourists formally .
composed of more than 100 circular small ponds , the park is planted with more than 300 varieties of ornamental lotus , water lilies and so on .
rural lotus industry is both ornamental and amusing , with economic benefits and has become the highlights for the development of new villages .
according to foreign media reports , the &quot; green pool &quot; incident of Rio Olympic Games gained much attention because its diving pool water was changed from blue to green .
however , on the morning of the 10th day of the month , the water of the match pool adjacent to the water pool also turned green .
Australian water polo contestant said that his eyes feel tingling and would like to shed tears .
previously , Rio officials confirmed the situation of water greening , and said the water color is due to the weakening of alkaline reasons and will not affect the athlete &apos;s health .
however , after Australian players achieved success with the Japanese delegation in the water polo pool , they said their eyes felt pricking .
when the water of diving pool turned green , the hosting party worked overtime to deal with the diving pool problems in the evening of the 9th day of the month and found the rapid change of water polo pool in the morning of the 10th day of the month .
during the competition period of the Australia and Japanese team , the environmental conditions of the water polo pond gradually worsened , but the official stressed that they would manage to return the water quality of the two pools to their original colors on the 11th day of the month .
Mario Andrada , the spokesman of Rio Olympic Games said , &quot; The alkalinity of water quality in the diving pool firstly turned weak after the yesterday afternoon . &quot;
&quot; we learned about a series of causes that could cause discoloration of water and result in the alkalinity of water quality . &quot;
the water sports center conducted a series of tests on water quality , and hundreds of divers and swimmers used the swimming pool to determine whether the water quality meets criteria . &quot;
&quot; we have been following the normal procedure these days , but we may have overlooked the impact of more athletes on water quality . &quot;
&quot; but the change in water color certainly has no effect on health , especially for athletes . &quot;
&quot; this independent team confirms our assessment and confirms the measures we have taken to restore the normal color and normal chemical status of the pool . &quot;
&quot; we had hoped that the pool would return to normal color in the morning , but the speed of recovery was affected by the rain . &quot;

on the morning of August 12 , the State Council Information Office held a press conference on the operation of the national economy in July 2016 .
Sheng Yunyun , spokesman of National Bureau of Statistics and head of National Economic Statistics Division said that , in July , the part index number of national economy slowed relatively but still operated in the reasonable range .
according to the data of National Bureau of Statistics , the fixed asset investment growth , total imports and other data in July have come down .
Sheng Laiyun said , as for the national economy in July , I would like to use the words of Premier , &quot; the shape is volatile and the potential is still good . &quot; this is a better way to summarize the characteristics of the economic operation in July .
he explained that &quot; the shape of the fluctuations &quot; refers to the fall after rise of some economic indicators growth rate in July .
in July , the domestic and international economy is still in the deep adjustment , the international situation is complex and volatile and the world economic recovery is less than expected , so the export pressure is still relatively heavy .
as for the domestic situation , the whole economy is still in the critical stage of adjustment , adjustment labor pains are releasing and the economy is under great pressure , so some indicators are still fluctuating .
Sheng Laiyun pointed out that there was a special case in July , with serious floods , high temperature and hot weather which have brought some impact on production and operation of some areas .
according to the recent report of the Ministry of Civil Affairs , more than 60 million people were affected , with direct economic losses of more than 200 billion yuan .
from the view of industrial , investment and transport @-@ related indicators , these areas are affected to varying degrees .
the cargo turnover growth rate in July fell back 3.6 percentage and floods on these areas have a certain impact on traffic .
from these factors , it is quite normal to have some fluctuations in some indicators . and such thing is expected .
he said , &quot; The potential is still good &quot; means that despite the fallback of economic growth , the overall economic performance is stable and steady . and the good momentum has not changed .
in July , CPI rose by 1.8 % , with a month @-@ on @-@ month rise of 0.2 % . from January to July , CPI rose by 2.1 % , so the overall price situation is stable .
according to the statistics of hot weather in the districts and counties by the portal of the Chongqing Municipal Bureau of Meteorology , in addition to Youyang , the rest of the city can receive different degrees of high temperature allowance .
at present , at least 28 provinces in the country have clearly defined the standard of the allowance , but the standards issued by provinces and municipalities are not the same , and people in Chongqing receive the allowance based on the count of high @-@ temperature working days .
in case of temperature between 35 and 37 ℃ , people can receive allowance of no less than 10 yuan per day . in case of temperature above 37 ℃ , people are released with the allowance of not less than 15 yuan .
in case of temperature above 40 ℃ , staff working in high temperature can receive up to 20 yuan per day of allowance ( but for laborers who enjoy the high temperature job allowance ) .
in accordance with this standard , people in Kaizhou which has the highest number of high temperature can receive 330 yuan . and people in Chengkou with the least days of high temperature can receive 80 yuan . and the maximum temperature of Youyang did not meet the high temperature standards , so there is no high temperature allowance .
in the past , many companies adopt cool drinks as high temperature allowance . the city safety supervision bureau deemed that this behavior does not meet the current regulation .
employer shall not deduct or reduce the wages of workers in case of terminating work and reducing working hours in high temperature weather .
the city &apos;s Human Resources and Social Security Bureau said that if employees did not receive high temperature allowance while working under high temperature , they may fight for the legitimate rights and interests via the labor dispute mediation organization or dial 12333 for complaint .
if the employing unit refuses to pay the high temperature allowance , the laborer may lodge a complaint with the competent department of human resources social security at the county level or above .
at the same time , because the high temperature allowance is part of the wage and not welfare , such allowance shall be included in the total wages , with tax deducted .
so the high temperature allowance is not within the minimum wage , it must be issued in cash and not substituted by physical objects such as drinks .
the newly built Urumqi station is located in Urumqi high @-@ speed rail area , with the whole construction area of around 100,000 square meters .
the layer 1 and 2 are for entrance , waiting room and office , commercial use while the layer -1 is for exit .
at present , Urumqi station is Xinjiang &apos;s largest integrated transport hub , integrated with high @-@ speed rail , rail transportation , public transportation and rental as one . people can achieve a variety of seamless dockings .
there are a total of 3 ticket offices on the north and south sides of the platform layer , equipped with manual ticketing windows and 34 automatic ticket machines .
there are a total of 30 channels on the east and west side of the waiting hall . passengers can check the ticket on the ticket number for quick inspection and waiting .
if you need help , you can choose the 41 call buttons and get timely services .
from July 1 onwards , the old passenger station , that is , the passenger train of Urumqi South Station is shifted to Urumqi station .
in other words , all the CRH trains and the 30 pairs of other trains departing from Xinjiang can be parked at Urumqi Station .
now , passengers can buy tickets at these two stations . the train passing time between these two stations is about 10 minutes . passengers need to pay attention to the detailed name of the initial and terminal station on the ticket .
Urumqi new passenger station , after its official launching into operation , will become an important platform to build the national integrated transport city and promote the construction of &quot; Silk Road Economic Zone &quot; and the new district .
Gracia is a cute female toucan , exuding the breath of tropical rain forest .
in Costa Rica , one of the Central American countries , Toucan Gracia and its story have long been known .
at the press conference on August 10 , after postoperative rehabilitation , Gresham finally appeared and showed people its brand new 3D printing plastic beak .
this toucan , which had its beak broken and was dying just one year and a half ago , finally regained its new life .
this day not only announced that it has restored health by 100 % , but also signaled its moving into the luxury aviary to meet its human friends .
the newcomer Grecia was slightly shy initially , but soon became lively , rolling in the basin frolic and eating grapes with a new beak .
in order to remind people that it has suffered damage , the technical staff did not give it a new beak color , but to retain the original white color of the 3D print material .
the beak is a thin layer of horny sheath , which is hollow inside and only has some of the thin bone to support .
despite this internal reinforcement , the toucan &apos;s beak is fragile and may be broken when it is hurt .
animal rescue center , ornithologist and a US 3D printing company worked together to prepare several &quot; test beak &quot; for Gracia and finally built a &quot; perfect beak &quot; for it .
now Gracia has been able to use the new beak to drink water , eat , and even peck fine grains .
&quot; the design of the finished product costs about two months and it just takes 4 @-@ 5 hours to print it . &quot;
&quot; 3D printing is not the future technology but really enters into your life . &quot; Thomas Lange , the chairman of US SG3D printing company said in an interview with Xinhua International .
in January 2015 , Gracia , lying on a farm in the town of Alajuela in the middle of Costa Rica , was found with blood covering on its body .
at that time , its beak was cruelly broken by a group of young people . it was completely unable to eat and dying .
after the tragedy of the Gracia was reported by the media , there are a tide of animal anti @-@ abuse call occurring inside and outside Costa Rica .
people demand to establish more rigorous animal protection law to enhance the punishment against abusers .
people came spontaneously to try their utmost to help Gracia restore its life before hurting .
even the inventor of the 3D printing technology , Chuck Hull , is also involved in the design of the Gracia beak .
&quot; the situation of Gracia is very special , and its remaining part of the beak is less than 1 centimeter , so there are many difficulties in installing the new beak . &quot;
&quot; we first scanned Gracia and then designed and produced an extended prosthesis slightly longer than the rest of its beak and fixed on its beak with glue . &quot;
&quot; this can reduce the risk of further intrusive damage to Gracia , &quot; Lange told Xinhua International .
before installing the prosthesis , the staff cleared the broken beak of Gracia every day to prevent infection .
thousands of miles away , the story of the Toucan Gracia touched the famous documentary director Paula El Reidia and the news channel producer John Hoffman .
they recorded a little bit of the process of installing a new beak , and recorded a documentary &quot; The Country of Toucan , &quot; which was played this month on the Animal Planet Channel .
the documentary &quot; The State of the Toucan &quot; shows people how a small Toucan has changed a country and how people get involved in the fight against torture of animals .
core Tip : Japanese oil companies expressed vigilance to the rise of Chinese oil companies , especially known as the &quot; teapot &quot; of China &apos;s small independent refinery .
August 12 report on Cankaoxiaoxi website : Japan &apos;s largest oil company JX Energy believes that &quot; China &apos;s export expansion is one of the reasons for the market downturn . &quot;
Japanese oil companies expressed vigilance to the rise of Chinese oil companies , especially known as the &quot; teapot &quot; of China &apos;s small independent refinery .
China &apos;s oil products are gradually close to Japan &apos;s oil products because the Chinese government has strengthened environmental protection regulations .
before obtaining the import license for crude oil , &quot; teapot refinery &quot; generally refines oil from the heavy oil , which has high sulfur content and is imported from Russia .
the petroleum products are poor in quality due to high sulfur content and become one of the causes of environmental pollution .
after obtaining crude oil import license , &quot; teapot refinery &quot; can import Oman crude oil and Russian crude oil , which have low sulfur content and improved petroleum products .
East Fuel General Oil Company said , &quot; With China &apos;s domestic oil product quality standards continuing to improve , the refining capacity of the equipment also increased .
as a result , the quality of oil products exported from China gradually rivalled that of Japan ( the world &apos;s highest quality ) .
according to JX Energy , &quot; After the end of 2015 , China began to export high @-@ quality light oil to Australia . &quot; such light oil products are competitive with Japanese products on the Asian market .
although the &quot; Japanese high quality oil &quot; falls into a crisis , the Japanese oil companies just adopted the strategy of &quot; exporting to profitable areas while being concerned about the market . &quot;
as China &apos;s exports of petroleum products have a huge impact on the Asian market , teapot refinery got more attentions .

UV not only tans your skin but also sunburns it , so how to make the skin go through the military training , without sunburn ?
sunblock is generally marked with SPF and PA on the package . SPF refers to Sun Protection Function and is targeted at UVB . the common SPF index includes 15 , 30 , 50 , etc .
the product marked with PA is for UVA , so that sunblock will play a more effective role . usually , the intensity of PA is represented with + . an extra + indicates extension of effective protection time .
water @-@ based sunblock with a strong penetration is often applied to oily skin . sunscreen spray is also a good choice .
creamy sunscreen is often applied to dry skin . the classification of neutral skin generally has no strict rules . any kind of skin care products are burden to the sensitive skin . so it is recommended to choose pure physical sunscreen products .
remember to apply sunblock half an hour in advance , because sunscreen products take time to completely penetrate into the skin .
because you are exposed to sun longer during the military training , you have to apply the sunscreen products once every two hours to lengthen the effect . so keep doing it .
as the skin has just been stimulated by the sun &apos;s sake , do not immediately use whitening products after returning from military training .
after exposure under the blazing sun for quite a long time , please wrap the ice with towel to ease the sunburned skin and alleviate the local heat if condition allowed .

during some nights , the ionized layer is full of free electrons , which means that the radio signal can go further .
according to the report of Popular Science , an American monthly website , on August 11 , the US Air Force was interested in copying this effect .
although the stable ionizing layer with a large number of free electrons may help people listen to the radio at the edge of a university radio station , but this may not be the interest of the US Air Force .
ionization layer full of electrons indicated the radio used by the military has a larger range of broadcasts . in addition , it may prevent the global positioning system ( GPS ) signal from the solar storm .
the final goal may be to build a series of cube satellite according to the requirement . they may enhance ionization layer when necessary .
but firstly , the team that signed contract with the air force must prove that the scientific principles will work .
industry data showed that the total size of coal production in 2015 was close to 6 billion tons and the national coal production overcapacity reached 1.8 billion tons .
over the past decade , the State Council has issued a total of five notices for the elimination of excessive and backward production capacity .
although the first four notices are not directly involved with coal industry , the target industry is directly related with coal industry .
from last November to this January , the price of Qinhuangdao 5500 kcal steam coal lingers at 370 yuan / ton and 90 % of the coal enterprises fell into a loss .
and since February , coal prices gradually picked up , Qinhuangdao steam coal prices rose continuously for four weeks , rose to 16 months high , once climbed to 436 yuan per ton , up nearly 70 yuan per ton over the beginning .
with the price rising , come along the concerns of various industries : will a number of small coal mines resume production ?
in this regard , Kuang Xianming , head of the Economic Research Institute of the China ( Hainan ) Reform and Development Institute , conducted an analysis and interpretation .
Kuang Xianming : overcapacity cut roused the high concerns to various industries . the report card of the overcapacity cut of the coal industry announced today make everyone feel worried indeed .
these three superficial factors reflect the reason behind the relative lagging behind of our growth pattern change . that is , the government @-@ led growth has not yet been fundamentally changed .
second , it is also directly related with the force of local government . during the overcapacity cut process , the funds and the corresponding supporting measures should be in place . from this point of view , the differences are indeed relatively large among different regions .
thirdly , some of the provinces that are relatively slow in progress may face greater risks if they seek acceleration in progress in the second half of the year .
in this case , relying on the central allowance to raise funds to promote the process of production capacity may have a negative impact .
first , the overcapacity cut is not a simple cap control .
our goal is to eliminate the backward production capacity , promote the optimization of the structure and restructure the new format of the entire coal industry .
during the process of overcapacity cut deploying , the local government must combine the production capacity and the transformation and upgrading of the coal industry to develop the relevant service industry .
second , in order to complete this year &apos;s overcapacity cut task within this year , we must give full play to the power of administrative supervision .
finally , we should strengthen the role of social security .
because the market is directly related to the employment problem , we have to strengthen the employment skills training of employees .
&quot; the reason for the ranking decline is that Brazilian GDP growth is expected to worsen in the medium term . &quot;
in 2015 , Brazil &apos;s participation in global direct investment was 3.7 % , down from 5.7 % in 2014 .
the International Investment Attractiveness Index of Credit Suisse Bank includes four sub @-@ indices : infrastructure , economic outlook , business environment and direct investment .
in 2015 , Brazil &apos;s international direct investment was $ 64.6 billion , down from $ 73.1 billion in 2014 .
last year , Brazil &apos;s &quot; green investment &quot; ( in the investment model of building factories abroad ) was $ 17.9 billion , a year @-@ on @-@ year fall of 2.1 % .
&quot; there are 288 &apos; green land investment &apos; projects in Brazil , with an average annual rise of 314 from 2003 to 2014 . &quot;
however , in the first half of 2016 , the international direct investment in Brazil had reached $ 33.8 billion , an increase of almost 10 per cent compared to the same period last year .
title : Canadian police killed IS supporters : homemade bomb attacks downtown preparations near the end
the taxi company said the taxi was dispatched to the Dreyfus before the police arrived .
Canadian police said at a news conference on Wednesday that the information received by the police included the &quot; martyrdom video &quot; sent by the young man to the US Federal Bureau of Investigation . according to the video , the young man will launch strike .
according to the German voice , in the video , a man wearing a black Barakella hat is reading the &quot; Koran , &quot; referred to the crime against Muslims , and vowed to attack a Canadian city sooner .
he said in the video , the attack will occur within 72 hours , and in the rush hour .
the incident is the first time for the police to kill terror suspects before the incident after Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau came to power last year .
Beijing @-@ Hangzhou Grand Canal branch channels Old Wanfu River and Beidaliu will charge tolls since September 1 .
the two tributaries will conduct construction via social financing . the charges have been approved by the relevant provincial government departments .
the old Wanfu River channel flows through Jinxiang , Yu Tai and then through the Nanyang Lake into the Beijing @-@ Hangzhou Grand Canal main channel , with a total length of 32.5 km .
according to the navigation needs , the old Wanfu River channel takes the mode of conservation and transformation . dredging was conducted on the local depth and curve cut @-@ off on the local sharp bend . then the navigation conditions can be improved .
the channel flows through Jinxiang County , Rencheng area and then through the Nanyang Lake into the Beijing @-@ Hangzhou Grand Canal main channel , with a total length of 19 km .
the renovation project of the two waterway started construction in February 2011 . the delivery inspection was conducted in January 2015 . the investment construction and operation main body is Jining City Anping Canal Logistics Service Center .
in accordance with the &quot; loan construction and charging for repaying loan &quot; principle , Jining City Anping Canal Logistics Service Center will collect channel tolls according to the charge standard approved by Shandong Provincial Price Bureau .
among them , the basic toll is 1.75 yuan / dwt and mileage toll is 0.05 yuan / km dwt .
the toll collection date is from June 15 , 2016 to June 14 , 2019 .
reporters learned from Jining Port and Waterway Bureau that there are a total of 4 toll channels within Jining territory , including Zhushuihe Channel , Baima River Channel , Beidahang Channel and Laowanfu Channel .
these four channels are Beijing @-@ Hangzhou Grand Canal tributary channels , which are upgraded and renovated in the way of social financing .
Zhushuihe Channel Upgrade Renovation Project is the first project adopting the mode of &quot; government + market &quot; for the infrastructure construction of river and ports within Shandong province . the government accounts for the major part of investment while social fund supplements the funding gap .
Baima River , the laowanfu River and Beidaliu River and other feeder routes adopt pure market operation .
the funds allocated by the state finance cannot meet the needs of the project construction and restrict the progress of the channel upgrade .
social funds for the construction of public infrastructure are in line with national policy requirements and have become a way to break the bottleneck of funding .
Ning Zetao &apos;s performance in the 100 meters freestyle semi @-@ final has made a lot of Chinese audience speechless .
actually , this 50 @-@ meter freestyle is not the subject of Ning Zetao . his performance and best achievement in Kazan World Championships also indicate it is not possible for him to make breakthrough in this project .
sure enough , Ta Kung Pao , an authoritative media in Hong Kong , revealed that the biggest reason for Ning Zetao to lose is that he has lost interest in swimming .
many factors may have a great impact on his future ideas . he is now more interested in entering the entertainment circle .
after Kazan World Championships , Ning Zetao instantly become celebrity with his good look and excellent performance .
as a result , &quot; national husband ( a good match ) , &quot; &quot; fresh little meat , &quot; &quot; gorgeous , &quot; etc. have become his label .
a variety of business activities came to him . he really have a golden flashing prospect .
in this case , that Ning Zetao chooses to withdraw and joins the entertainment circle , is not only his freedom , but also a seemingly viable way .
after all , he is only 23 years old . after a certain degree of study , he can perform some TV series with his popularity .
but Ning Zetao needs to see whether he is qualified enough compared with his predecessors .
at the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games , the already 21 @-@ year @-@ old Liu Xuan came to the end of athlete career .
the beautiful appearance of Liu Xuan makes her quickly remembered and also lays a foundation for her to join the entertainment circle .
after retirement , Liu Xuan starred in a number of TV series , and in 2013 she set up her own studio .
Tian Liang participated in the single and double ten @-@ meter match of two Olympic Games , and won 2 gold and 2 silver .
but when he was defeated by his counterpart Hu Jia at the single 10 @-@ meter match in the 2004 Olympic Games , Tian Liang &apos;s competitive state slipped and it was said he was dismissed by the diving team .
but when he took along his daughter to participate in the variety show &quot; Dad , Where Are We Going ? , &quot; he became a focus .
the once gold generation Yang Wei , Li Xiaopeng and Chen Yibing all participated in a variety of variety show .
it is worth mentioning that , Yang Wei and Li Xiaopeng led the Chinese team and won champion in the 2008 Olympic Games men &apos;s team . Yang Wei even got his individual all @-@ around gold medal twice and was called as the Almighty King .
and Chen Yibing has become a ring king while leading his team to win the champion in the 2012 Olympic Games men &apos;s team .
but after he was misjudged and lost the gold in the London Olympic Games , his magnanimous act won him so many funs .
however , these game players mainly focus on the venue , they just touch and then go at the variety show .
however , no matter whether they are retired or active athletes , they need to provide outstanding performance to win in the entertainment circle .
after all , athletes have just stepped into a new area , so it is just a space state for them in case of capabilities and connection .
even for Tian Liang and Liu Xuan , who are not new in the entertainment circle , common people always think of their performance at the Olympic Games when mentioning them .
and the introduction of Yang Wei and Li Xiaopeng at the variety show is always Olympic Games Champion .
compared with these people , Ning Zetao is slightly weaker for the title of Swimming World Championships .
compared with these people , the title of Ning Zetao , a swimming world championship , is not so great .
moreover , compared with the withdrawal of Tian Liang , Liu Xuan and Yang Wei , etc. at their peaks , the withdrawal of Ning Zetao at 23 after some setback would cause immeasurable effects to the negative influence of his image .
after all , at the mention of athletes , people &apos;s requirements on athletes are &quot; not seeking victory but for no fear of danger . &quot; Ning Zetao lags far behind from this point .
at the very least , Ning Zetao can totally rely on his great looks to win the support of thousands of huge fans .
it is a lot more difficult to be famous in the entertainment circle by just relying on good appearance than training .
you have to listen to your inner voice on your life path . but as for how to choose , Ning Zetao should be quite conscious .
on the surface , the online social platform expands our social circle and reduces people &apos;s loneliness .
the sphere of influence of social networking not only replaces the traditional telephone contact , but also gets down to the offline living circle , quietly changing the current social life of the people .
the benefits of online social network are obvious , convenient and quick , so it is particularly vulnerable to the favor of young people .
a survey of college students &apos; social habits shows that 57 % of college students spend more than 5 hours on mobile phone and is almost inseparable to his mobile phone during their daily lives .
&quot; social network features low cost , fast transmission speed and simultaneous communication among several people . this meets the requirement of modern college students . &quot;
expanding the interpersonal relationship circle , more equal dialogue , avoiding social concerns are major reasons for us to be fascinated with online chat .
new comers in the company love online exchange with colleagues . &quot; we are not familiar with each other when we just come to the company . the likes and comments on social platform makes people much closer to one another . &quot;
people who love to make friends also love online communication . &quot; I lost contact with my friends due to some misunderstandings . we became familiar again after a few dialogues on the group chatting . &quot;
it engineer Wu Yan is a profound social networking lovers . his majority social life occurred online and his online contact is several times than that of offline friends .
Wu Yan himself admitted that the network is more &quot; in his element . &quot;
&quot; you can respond to your friends when you are willing , because there is a lot of time to think over the words and you can express it more clearly .
&quot; the communication hidden below one &apos;s ID can avoid interpersonal clash . this not only has room for maneuver , and even gives each other more time and space to thought and deeds . &quot;
&quot; people of different identities have the same rights and efficiency to speech . various social concerns during real life may be eliminated immediately on internet . &quot;
however , Xiaopeng , a friend of Wu Yan , thought that Wu Yan is a &quot; very boring otaku . &quot;
Xiaopeng and Wuyan meet each other in the group chatting . they two get familiar with each other because they are active speakers .
Xiaopeng thought that Wuyan is quite different from the one on internet . he is quite bored and does not take the initiative to express his views . his words are repeated like this , &quot; Oh , yes , right , &quot; or &quot; I will check it online . &quot;

on August 11 , when the reporter called Huang Yilin , who was in his Mianyang home , she said , &quot; At that time , it was too urgent . and there was just one idea , which is to rescue people ! &quot;
Huang Yilin was a student of grade 2015 in the Landscape Architecture College of Central South University of Forestry and Technology .
majored in urban and rural planning , Huang Yilin wanted to visit Sichuan Langzhong and learn the local architectural design , so the family were bound for there .
at around 10 a.m. on August 8th , Huang Yilin &apos;s father was having a rest in the hotel , while Huang Yilin and his mother went to stroll the Langzhong ancient city .
not walking too far , they saw a group of people shouting , so they approached for curiosity .
seeing the &quot; little boy has just disappeared and the little girl desperately fluttered in the water , just with her little brain left above the water and keeping sinking , &quot; Huang Yilin , who learned how to swim hurriedly jumped to rescue people .
after jumping into the water , the 165cm @-@ tall Huang Yilin found that she cannot touch the bottom !
the calm @-@ looking river had rapids in the bottom .
but she still desperately swam to the little girl .
Huang Yilin said the river was muddy and run fast . the only 5 @-@ meter distance almost wore her out .
she tried her best to push the little girl to the embankment . &quot; the slope is particularly slippery , and I am afraid that I have no strength but to sink . &quot;
so Huang Yilin called to her mother for help . hearing her daughter &apos;s call , Ms.Yin tried to rescue and was held up by other people .
on August 10 , after the spread of the event of Huang Yilin &apos;s jumping into the river for rescue . Ms. Yin received the condolences and compliments of a lot of friends and relatives as well as the &quot; concerns &quot; of many relatives and friends .
&quot; now , in retrospect , it &apos;s really scared ! to be honest , when my child does not hold on to the riverbank , my heart is broken soon . &quot;
Ms. Yin said with a lingering fear that , despite the danger , she will still support her daughter &apos;s choice and she is proud of her daughter even if she was placed in that scene again !
because she was forced to learn swimming , she seldom went to swim after mastering the skill . &quot; I did not expect this skill really to come in handy . &quot;
according to Chen Yiyang , her supervisor , Huang Yilin is the &quot; The Straight A Student &quot; well @-@ known in her class and ready to help .

sun Fujian is a Party cadre , but he lost his ideal and belief by violently breaking the discipline of the Party after the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China . in addition , he is not astringent and breaks the rules . such deed is vile and grave indeed .
after the occurrence of this case and a number of media reports , this has become the focus of the case , with extremely bad social impact .
after the case , Haikou City Public Security Bureau of Interpol detachment leaders attach great importance and immediately organize a detachment of elite troops to take the initiative to investigate .
the police immediately pursued and attacked the suspect on the internet and took a variety of measures to control . in addition , the police contacted their colleagues of other cities to investigate the whereabouts of Wang .
as the suspect is a stealing recidivism and repeatedly dealt with by the public security organs , he has strong anti @-@ reconnaissance capabilities . in addition , due to his long @-@ term drug abuse , the often drug addiction makes trial work quite difficult .
Greenland sharks are also known as small head sleeping sharks , widely distributed in Greenland and the North Atlantic waters around Iceland . it has the length of 4 to 5 meters in their adult age .
but their growth rate is extremely slow , sometimes only about 1 cm a year , suggesting that Greenland shark may have an extra @-@ long life .
traditional dating methods usually use calcified tissue of animals . some fins can use fins , but this calcified tissue is very scarce in Greenland sharks .
a new study led by Julius Nelson of the University of Copenhagen , Denmark , turned to the use of Greenland shark &apos;s ocular lens for radioactive carbon dating .
this method had previously been used to determine the age of whales , but it is the first time to be used to determine the age of sharks and other fish .
their analysis showed that the life span of the largest shark is estimated at 392 years old , with the error of 120 years old .
that is to say , this shark is aged at least 272 years old . the maximum age may be 512 years old .
in addition , the female Greenland shark is alleged to be sexually matured at about 4 meters in length . that is , it can only reach adulthood at least until the age of 156 .
the researchers thus wrote in the paper that the Greenland shark was known as the vertebrate with the longest life span on the Earth , surpassing the age of the previous longevity champion black right whale ( 211 years ) .

last year , the last remittance measure before &quot; 8.11 &quot; exchange reform was carried out in 2005 . the appreciation of yuan against dollar was significant during the last 10 years .
since the implementation of the new exchange reform , the previous appreciation state of RMB was changed . the central parity rate of RMB exchange rate in one year was about 8 % .
this October 1 , the International Monetary Fund will officially accept the yuan , which will become SDR weight currency .

in late August , Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will go to Kenya to attend the 6th African Development Conference , according to the Evening News Peak of Voice of China .
the African Development Conference was dominated by Japan , and the previous five meetings were held in Tokyo , Japan or Yokohama , so this meeting will be the first move to Africa .
Japanese Foreign Ministry officials said the meeting held in Africa will help to attract attentions of African and European countries to Japan .
in line with the trip of Shinzo Abe , according to Kyodo news agency , the Japanese Liberal Democrats will send parliamentary groups to the countries concerned .
Japan &apos;s &quot; application to become a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council &quot; began in the early 90s of the last century while the African @-@ sponsored African Development Conference also began in 1993 . this is not a coincidence .
Africa has 53 seats in the United Nations and is therefore an important ticket bunker of the United Nation . how can Japan give up Africa if it wanted to join the United Nations Security Council ?
it will also exchange views with national stakeholders on the extreme organization of &quot; Islamic State &quot; and terrorist activities .
&quot; Western Group &quot; will visit seven countries , including Sierra Leone , Liberia and Guinea Bissau .
Fumio Kishida , the current Minister for Foreign Affairs of Japan has also recently stated the intentions of the African Development Conference at the UN Security Council .
Abe has announced here that in order to stabilize the stability of sub @-@ Saharan African countries , it will provide 100 billion yen ( about RMB 6.1 billion ) in five years .
observers generally believe that there are two purposes behind Japan &apos;s generosity toward Africa : first , to increase Japan &apos;s presence in Africa ; second , to win the support of African countries on the application to become a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council .
&quot; in terms of politics , Africa is relatively lagging behind , but there are many African countries . so Japan has always regarded it as the so @-@ called &apos; big ticket field , &apos; &quot; said Yang BOJIANG , an expert for Japanese issues .
Japan will not give up in the future and its work on Africa will not be terminated but gradually strengthened .
economically , Japan enjoys a strong production capacity , but its domestic market is relatively limited . in particular , the domestic demand is relatively weak in the context of aging population .
however , from Junichiro Koizumi , who was Japan &apos;s prime minister 10 years ago , to the present Abe , Japan has repeatedly launched the &quot; sprint &quot; scheme . however , all schemes were abandoned eventually .
Yang BOJIANG believed that the intension of Japan to become a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council is be clear at a glance . however , the road is bound to be full of obstacles .
to achieve its own goals , Japan should firstly do a good job with the surrounding countries . and Japan needs to have a correct attitude no matter in geopolitical competition or in the national dispute or understanding of a historical problem .

&quot; after knowing this special festival online , I decided to come and I felt quite fresh . &quot;
they said , although there are similar festivities commemorating the ancestors , the atmosphere is quite solemn . but here you can enjoy music , food and also can learn traditional craft .
she said , &quot; It is quite pleasant to see sizable and organized ancestor worship ceremony in such a busy financial metropolis of Hong Kong . &quot;
&quot; this not only embodies the diversity of Chinese culture , but also allows more people to understand these traditional craft and heritage . &quot;

the audience sometimes smiled and sometimes applauded for the changing and concluding of the &quot; White Snake &quot; episode and the actor &apos;s singing .
I watched the performance of Marissa Jimenez Kachie accompanying her daughter in the Peking opera performance 15 years ago .
&quot; this is a fantastic performance . its music , lighting and stage performances are impressive to me ... ... I think it is necessary to let her daughter understand the Chinese culture and Chinese opera art . &quot;
the enthusiasm of Mexican audience left a deep impression on the young actress of lady white .
&quot; it never occurred to me that the Mexican audience were so enthusiastic . I had some worries about whether they could understand the story , but it was beyond my expectation to see them catch the story and the laughter today .
Qiu Xiaoqi , the Chinese ambassador to Mexico , said that the various cultural exchange activities of this year &apos;s &quot; Sino @-@ Latin American Cultural Exchange Year &quot; promoted the two peoples to deepen mutual understanding and enhance their friendship .
next year is the 45th anniversary for the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Mexico . by then there will be more cultural exchange activities held in China and Mexico .
Liu Cigui came to Sanya for the research of &quot; Double Restoration and Dual City &quot; and required to enhance the level of urban construction and management
in the morning of 12th day of the month , Liu Cigui presided over a symposium , listened to the report of the progress of the pilot project of &quot; Double Restoration and Dual City &quot; and the suggestions and comments of the relevant departments .
Liu Cigui provided fully affirmation for the stage results and good experiences and practice .
Liu Cigui stressed that Sanya should firmly grasp the historical development opportunities and take the pilot work of &quot; Double Restoration and Dual City &quot; as key content to give full play to the leading role of demonstration during the economic and social development in order to firmly grasp historical development opportunities .
we should lead to improve the internationalization of international tourism and enrich international elements and build international boutique from the details .
we should lead in the urban and rural integration and tourism , accelerate the construction of characteristic town and integrate tourism into each project and build each village and town of Sanya into tourist attractions .
we should lead in &quot; the 100 @-@ day social service investment move &quot; and promote a batch of key projects and park construction to ensure the settlement of high @-@ quality project and implement the various requirements of the big move .
Zhang Qi , the Provincial Standing Committee and Sanya Municipal Party Committee Secretary , Wang Lu , vice governor and Lu Zhiyuan , secretary general of provincial government participated in the research seminars .
in the 14 years of her sports career , Deng Yaping won a total of 18 world championships , becoming the first Chinese to win four Olympic gold medals in China &apos;s Olympic history .
she ranked first in the table tennis for 8 years to maintain the world &apos;s first and is a female athlete to rank as the &quot; the world &apos;s first &quot; for the longest time in the history of table tennis .
on September 26 , 2010 , she served as Deputy Secretary @-@ General of People &apos;s Daily , general manager of People &apos;s Search Network Co . , Ltd. and the department @-@ level cadre .
recently , she will work together with Yu Minhong to build the first domestic sports industry innovation and entrepreneurship platform .
there was also a team of star coaches in the Chinese sports circle . they were gorgeous in the era of athletes and won countless glory for the country . after retirement , they passed what they learned to the new comers and cultivated a great number of champions .
as the first world champion in Chinese men &apos;s gymnastics , Huang Yubin chose to pick up the pointer after retirement .
from the women &apos;s team coach to the men &apos;s team coach , to the head coach , Huang Yubin created an &quot; Olympic gold group , &quot; and led to win 9 gold , 1 silver and 4 copper at the Beijing Olympic Games .
since then , Tian Liang has been experiencing advertising endorsement . he has even served as a &quot; Cowherd , &quot; &quot; Lei Feng &quot; and other important roles in recent years .
many NBA players have proved their strength . but whenever there is progress , there is decline .
whether it is because of the increase in age or limited playing time , some players will have regressive performance each season .
of course , some &quot; retreat &quot; may only be data shrink , but the strength of these players may not have been reduced .
even if Wade is still one of the league &apos;s best linebacker , his performance in the Bulls is not so good as that of the Heat .
the backcourt range of he and Londo is limited . the three @-@ point hit rate of headed star Butler is just 32.8 % , making their next @-@ season offence quite challenging .
after coming to Feng Cheng , the Red Star will definitely give the ball right to Butler and Rondo and he himself choose to play healthy in the regular season .
Okafor &apos;s situation is more embarrassing . as the first choice of 76 people last season , he had to compete for playing time and ball right with Simmons and enby in the new season .
this competition may not come soon . Simmons also need to adapt to the NBA stadium , and Enbi must also be fully recovered from the injury as soon as possible , but whether Okafor can have a position in the long array of 76 people .
last season , 32 % of the score of Okafor comes from the low attack . such rate is higher than Cousins , Wuchevich and Brook Lopez , while his use rate is also the top 40 in the league .
with Simmons already showing a good point @-@ forward potention , Enbi also has a better stature more suitable for NBA games and Okafor &apos;s position is hard to be so solid .
over the past two seasons , Thompson &apos;s use rate has stabilized in the top 20 of the league and this is the best two seasons for his career .
but the problem is , with the arrival of Durant , Thompson &apos;s appearance ratio will surely decline , which is bound to affect his play .
this effect will not only be the impact of the number of shots , Thompson &apos;s holding attack in the next season will certainly be greatly reduced , which in some ways will reduce the opponent &apos;s defense difficulty .
Durant &apos;s arrival will certainly negatively affect the score of Warriors players , but the one with the most negative effect is probably that of Thompson .
but this does not mean that the level of Thompson steps backward . this is more likely that he made sacrifice for the team as a whole .
Parker had a better performance than last season . this is not only because his basket efficiency came to the highest level , his chemical reaction with Aldrich also benefits the Spurs .
Duncan retired , Ginobili announced a second battles for a year and the combination of GDP eventually came to an end . as one of the youngest among three people , the oil tank of French sports car is not much left .
after getting the third championship ring , only Jabbar , Jordan and Russell won more regular MVP than that of James , while Jordan was the only one who had more FMVP than that of James .
Oh , yes , James has just brought the first professional sports championship trophy in Cleveland in the past 52 years .
coming to the 14th season of his career , James needs to better conserve his strength and get ready for the playoffs .
therefore , in the regular season , James &apos;s capability is likely to further decline , he will give more weight to Owen to bear , but he will still easily become the league &apos;s top three players .
&quot; I must carry forward what I learned in China to apply to Russia . &quot;
on the 12th day of the month of the local time , Huang Jing , chairman of the Moscow Overseas Chinese Association said excitedly while she saw the reporter of Chinanews.com.
not long ago , she participated in the &quot; overseas Chinese culture community Chinese talent ( calligraphy , painting ) training &quot; hosted by Chinese State Council Overseas Chinese Affairs Office and sponsored by Jinan University .
while participating in the training course just now , she did not know where to start in painting and calligraphy . as a result , after the end of the course , she has been able to draw and write her own works .
after returning back to Moscow , I will use the knowledge and skills learned in China to Russia and make my own contribution for the cultural transmission and promotion of the Chinese culture .
at the same time , Na Yanwei , the Secretary @-@ General of Russian @-@ Chinese Culture Promotion Association who also participated in this training course had the same feeling .
she said that she made great progress with the help of teachers of the training classes and she felt the heavy responsibility of being the &quot; overseas communicator of Chinese culture &quot;
she said , after she came back to Russia , she would surely carry out the traditional Chinese culture among the Chinese and the Russians who love Chinese culture .

Britain settle for silver in rugby sevens after Fiji masterclass sees them take gold
great Britain &apos;s impressive run in the Rugby 7s was brought to a crashing halt at the final hurdle by Fiji in the final on Thursday night when they were comprehensively beaten 43 @-@ 7 at the Deodoro Stadium here in Rio .
Fiji gave a masterclass in handling , off @-@ loading , side @-@ stepping , support play , running lines and brute strength to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any colour .
defeat came with the non @-@ too shabby consolation of silver - Britain &apos;s third of the day - and they could be proud of their efforts in the inaugural Olympic 7s tournament in which they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa along the way .
the bruising beating of the Boks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ final earlier in the day , may have come back to bite them in the final .
but , regardless , Fiji on this form would have beaten a fit as a fiddle 15 @-@ man team .
it may be some consolation to GB - but probably not - that at least one Briton will have a gold medal around his neck tomorrow : Fiji &apos;s head coach is Ben Ryan , the former England boss from Wimbledon .
it has been some journey for GB .
eight years ago , under Ryan , they lost every game at the Adelaide Sevens .
here , they lost just one .
this hammering will hurt but the progress is startling .
Fiji started magnificently , bouncing off GB tackles for fun .
it was like running into a series of moving buses for captain Tom Mitchell and co and the World Series champions went 5 @-@ 0 up when Osea Kolinisau dived over in the corner .
with four minutes on the clock Jerry Tuwai added another down the right wing , which was converted .
12 @-@ 0 and GB had hardly touched the ball .
a superb Mitchell tackle stopped the man @-@ mountain Leone Nakarawa from scoring a third but it was only delaying Fiji .
on seven minutes Jasa Veremalua touched down in the right corner and GB were 17 @-@ 0 to the bad .
Nakarawa added another from the restart and there was still over a minute on the clock ... in the first half .
Vatemo Ravouvou then burst through some more limp GB tackling and stormed to the line to score .
the conversion made it 29 @-@ 0 at the break .
it was as if Fiji had been born to play 7s , while GB are still learning the trade .
which is pretty much how it is .
GB made wholesale changes at half @-@ time and they plugged the Fijian dam ... for all of four minutes , which by first @-@ half standards was good , until Josua Tuisova went over after some brilliant Fijian interplay .
Dan Norton grabbed a try for GB , touching down in the left corner to make it 36 @-@ 7 but the game was long gone the way of the South Sea Islanders whose fans sang , waved flags and danced in the stands .
it was hard not to admire Fiji &apos;s whole joyful approach .
Mata Viliame iced the Fijian cake that didn &apos;t need icing with another try in the dying moments .
the whistle went , the Fijians embraced and GB hit the turf , thoroughly beaten .
earlier in the day , Fiji had beaten Japan 20 @-@ 5 in their semi @-@ final and GB edged South Africa in a tight semi @-@ final of one try each - Britain &apos;s conversion the difference .
Kyle Brown put the Boks ahead in the first half but Dan Norton with some dazzling footwork broke the line and scored under the posts in the second half .
a brilliant late tackle from Marcus Watson , brother of England &apos;s 15 @-@ aside team , Anthony , secured the win - and ultimately the silver medal .
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired to rowing victory by coach &apos;s cancer battle
there will not be a more emotive gold at these games , and that is saying something .
from the first stroke to the last , 220 punishing heaves into history , Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found added meaning in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa .
though they were the two pulling on the oars , there were three voices in that boat , the echo of coach Robin Williams ever present as they powered to a second successive Olympic gold in the women &apos;s pairs , the first females in the annals of British sport to scale such a height .
their dominance was absolute , after all this was their 39th outing unbeaten , again unprecedented .
what we see , two brilliant athletes skating over the surface with the elegance of swans , does not wholly reflect the nature of the triumph .
behind every rowing gold is a battalion of willing hands contributing the incremental gains that make the difference , and no hands were more instrumental than those of a coach who 30 months ago did not know whether he would live to see this day when diagnosed with cancer .
as he said , it was touch and go .
I had bladder cancer which is one of the things they can operate on and they did .
if they don &apos;t it goes everywhere .
it would have been a pretty bad situation .
it alters your outlook a bit .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio were fortunate that he was able to begin his treatment at the start of 2014 out of season , keeping the disruption to a minimum , if that is ever the right expression in circumstances such as these .
I needed to get paid so I had to get better quickly .
it was an incentive .
I was in hospital and I was walking around the ward - 20ft , 30ft 50ft at a time when they were saying a few steps is enough .
that &apos;s how it starts off .
rowing in itself is a journey but that makes it a bit bigger .
in the immediacy of victory their first thoughts were for Williams , who had spent a nervy morning talking a little more than usual in an attempt to process his own anxieties .
Stanning , a captain in the Royal Artillery regiment with a tour of Afghanistan behind her , said &quot; I &apos;ve been an emotional wreck this week , maybe that &apos;s a bit extreme , but it means such a lot . &quot;
it just reiterates how much this means to me , how much me and Helen have worked and Robin as well .
it &apos;s been a fantastic three years back with Helen and Robin .
without Robin we would be nobody , so a massive thanks to him he &apos;s the best coach in the world .
I couldn &apos;t have asked for a better person to train with , or a better coach .
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning haven &apos;t lost a race in five years .
the pair set a punishing rhythm that their rivals could never match .
even in the final 500 metres when the crews from New Zealand and Denmark began to close , Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve .
we were very much in the moment .
Helen was calling &apos; stay in the process , stay in the process &apos; .
it &apos;s really important not to get carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we weren &apos;t looking to do anything amazing .
we weren &apos;t looking for fireworks today , we were just looking to do a good row and to go out and win that race , which we did .
the pair will take a year before deciding their futures .
Glover has a wedding to attend next month , her own to television adventurer Steve backShall .
for now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say this was my last race .
that would have meant too much pressure .
in London it took about six months to realise that I was an Olympic champion .
it was all so new and I was so stressed .
here it took about four minutes .
this feels so much better , &quot; she said .

Snapchat &quot; Anime &quot; Effect Is Criticized as Asian Caricature
Snapchat says this filter is inspired by anime , but some observers say it &apos;s racially insensitive .
with its lens tool , Snapchat allows some 150 million daily users to alter reality and play with identity in ways that border on the absurd .
you can turn yourself into a pineapple , a dog or a character befitting a Roy Lichtenstein painting .
the lenses are blunt , feature @-@ warping tools that generate more than 30 million enhanced selfies a day .
any missteps quickly enter the public record .
Snapchat lenses have drawn criticism in the past with accusations that the app was promoting blackface or encouraging whitened skin tones as an ideal of beauty .
so when it pushed a lens to some users this week that gave them slanted eyes , distorted teeth and puffy cheeks , some critics called it a racist caricature of Asian people - &quot; yellowface . &quot;
and they wondered if these repeated controversies pointed to a larger problem that the company has with diversity .
the news and the outrage went wide on Wednesday , with reports by The Verge and Motherboard , a day after Snapchat said it had dismantled the feature .
the company offered an explanation : the lens was meant as homage to anime characters , not as a caricature of Asian people .
but for observers who have experienced racism , the lens reminded them of hurtful stereotypes in action .
others roundly rejected the anime comparison .
in an email , Grace Sparapani , a Korean American art student whose tweet about the photos was widely shared , said that the lens was &quot; hurtful and uncomfortable to say the least . &quot;
she added that &quot; it &apos;s hard to argue with the side by side comparison of the very gross Asian caricature and the filter &apos;s effects .
it shows that the filter isn &apos;t just yellowface , but yellowface taken to its derogatory extreme .
Snapchat is not the only company to cross these cultural tripwires .
American culture seems involved in an endless struggle over diversity and inclusion , from corporate boardrooms to Hollywood and the devices we all carry in our hands .
and Snapchat &apos;s huge audience of younger people - who are more racially diverse than their older counterparts - might mean that they are even more likely to expect sensitivity .
when one of Snapchat &apos;s lenses creates an image that is insulting to a user , 25 @-@ year @-@ old Katie Zhu said in an interview on Thursday , &quot; it &apos;s much harder for these types of things to go unnoticed like they did before . &quot;
on Thursday , Ms. Zhu , a product manager and engineer who works for Medium , decided to delete her Snapchat account and encouraged others to do the same .
in an essay for Medium and in a telephone interview , she said she believed that the race @-@ related controversies reflected a lack of diversity in hiring practices at Snapchat .
Ms. Zhu criticized the company &apos;s mostly white , all @-@ male leadership and ended her essay with a hashtag : # DeleteSnapchat .
&quot; it &apos;s either that they had no diverse representation of people of color on their staff to the point where they &apos;re able to make decisions like this , &quot; Ms. Zhu , who is Chinese @-@ American , said , &quot; or they do have some people of color who are working there , but they &apos;re not on positions where they feel safe or comfortable to speak up . &quot;
other observers share her view , a complaint that Snapchat has left largely unanswered .
the company does not release figures about diversity on its staff , noting its status as a private company .
on Thursday , Snapchat declined to discuss the racial backgrounds of its staff , but according to a spokesman , the company recently hired a recruiter to focus on underrepresented populations and on driving inclusion efforts internally .
for her part , Ms. Zhu said she would keep her Snapchat account closed , adding , &quot; I wonder if they actually need more users like us to be able to say that this is not O.K. &quot;
military Officials Distorted ISIS Intelligence , Congressional Panel Says
officials from the United States Central Command altered intelligence reports to portray a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than events on the ground warranted , a congressional panel said in a report issued Thursday .
the interim report , from a task force established by the Republican chairmen of the House Armed Services Committee , Intelligence Committee and Defense Appropriations Subcommittee , found &quot; widespread dissatisfaction &quot; among Central Command intelligence analysts , who said superiors were doctoring their assessments of American efforts to defeat the Islamic State .
Central Command , known as CENTCOM , is the military headquarters in Tampa , Fla . , that oversees American military operations across the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; intelligence products approved by senior CENTCOM leaders typically provided a more positive depiction of U.S. antiterrorism efforts than was warranted by facts on the ground and were consistently more positive than analysis produced by other elements of the intelligence community , &quot; a news release about the report said .
&quot; what happened at CENTCOM is unacceptable - our war fighters suffer when bad analysis is presented to senior policy makers , &quot; said Representative Ken Calvert , Republican of California .
the leadership failures at CENTCOM reach to the very top of the organization .
the 10 @-@ page report detailed persistent problems in 2014 and 2015 in Central Command &apos;s description and analysis of American efforts to train Iraqi forces .
although it offers no definitive evidence that senior Obama administration officials ordered the reports to be doctored , it describes analysts as feeling as though they were under pressure from CENTCOM leaders to present a more optimistic view of the threat posed by the Islamic State , also known as ISIS or ISIL .
&quot; throughout the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , statements and congressional testimonies were significantly more positive than actual events , &quot; the report said .
for example , a CENTCOM official stated publicly that a major military assault to take back Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015 .
Mosul , Iraq &apos;s second @-@ largest city , remains under the control of the Islamic State .
&quot; after months of investigation , this much is very clear , &quot; Representative Mike Pompeo , Republican of Kansas , said in a statement .
from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the United States Central Command &apos;s most senior intelligence leaders manipulated the command &apos;s intelligence products to downplay the threat from ISIS in Iraq .
Republicans created the task force after learning that analysts had raised concerns that intelligence about the Islamic State was being manipulated .
the report released Thursday is to be followed up by more extensive findings as the investigation continues .
there is an additional , ongoing investigation of CENTCOM intelligence by the Department of Defense inspector general .
Democratic members of the House Intelligence Committee released their own findings on Thursday that agreed with some of the conclusions of the Republican task force .
&quot; between 2014 and 2015 , CENTCOM created an overly insular process for producing intelligence assessments on ISIL and Iraqi Security Forces , &quot; Representative Adam B. Schiff , the committee &apos;s top Democrat , said in a statement .
this process , Mr. Schiff said , &quot; stalled the release of intelligence products , &quot; hurt morale among analysts and &quot; insufficiently accommodated dissenting views . &quot;
but Mr. Schiff and the Democrats said they found no evidence that the White House tried to pressure CENTCOM analysts to fit their conclusions to a &quot; preset or political narrative . &quot;
the preliminary results of the congressional investigation were reported Tuesday by The Daily Beast .
last August , The New York Times reported the existence of the Pentagon inspector general investigation , opened after complaints by CENTCOM analysts .
Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans , a Pentagon spokesman , said in a statement that the Defense Department would not comment on the congressional report while the inspector general &apos;s investigation continued .
but he said that &quot; experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of complex data , and the intelligence community and Department of Defense welcome healthy dialogue on these vital national security topics . &quot;
the investigation has repercussions beyond the question of whether the American @-@ led bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria is succeeding ( an assertion now made by a growing number of Defense officials ) .
but last year &apos;s allegations called into question how much President Obama could rely on Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis spots .
the critiques on the Islamic State intelligence mirror disputes of more than a decade ago , when a CENTCOM intelligence analyst , Gregory Hooker , wrote a research paper saying that the administration of President George W. Bush , over many analysts &quot; objections , advocated a small force in Iraq and spent little time thinking about what would follow the 2003 invasion .
Mr. Hooker also played a key part in the insurrection over the Islamic State intelligence .
last year , officials said , Mr. Hooker &apos;s team concluded that despite public statements to the contrary , airstrikes against Islamic State @-@ held refineries had not significantly weakened the terrorist group &apos;s finances because it had built makeshift refineries to sell oil on the black market .
but the finding was not distributed outside Central Command , The Times reported in September .
CENTCOM &apos;s commander then , Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III , came under criticism last year after Senate testimony viewed by many lawmakers as being an overly positive assessment of the war .
General Austin retired in April and was replaced at Central Command by Gen. Joseph L. Votel .
U.S. Wins 4th Straight in Women &apos;s Field Hockey , Setting Up Showdown With Britain
one day after scoring three goals in a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , Katie Bam scored the first two goals for the United States women &apos;s field hockey team on Thursday as the Americans defeated India , 3 @-@ 0 .
five goals in two games should be a memorable feat , but Bam , 27 , said she was not sure if she had ever done the same thing .
&quot; I have no clue , &quot; she said .
I &apos;m not really one of those people who keeps track of their goals .
here is what she does know : the Americans are 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic tournament and are tied for first place in their group with Britain , which remained unbeaten after defeating Japan , 2 @-@ 0 , on Thursday .
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round .
both teams have qualified for the quarter finals , and the game will decide who finishes first in their six @-@ team bracket and who finishes second .
the first @-@ place finisher will avoid the powerful Dutch , the leaders of the other bracket , for a bit longer when the quarter finals begin .
however Saturday &apos;s game turns out , the Americans have created a stir with their surprising run here , four years after finishing last among 12 teams at the London Games .
BAM was on that team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pa . , first picked up a field hockey stick when she was 3 ( her twin older sisters played the sport at Drexel ) and joined the national team when she was 16 , becoming its youngest player ever .
she missed out on the 2008 Olympics when she did not make the cut for the final roster .
then came 2012 , when nothing much went right for her and her teammates .
the next year , Craig Parnham , an Englishman , was named the coach , and things began to change .
&quot; a cultural change , a mental change , a physical change , &quot; Bam said .
we didn &apos;t have the work rate in London that we have now .
we &apos;ve made a complete turnaround .
on Thursday night , Bam opened the scoring in the first half with a backhand shot from close in .
India had come into the game without a victory in the tournament , but the team proved surprisingly tough and kept the score 1 @-@ 0 until late in the third period , when Bam took charge .
she made a long run with the ball down the left side of the field , then curled into the middle and whipped the ball into the goal to give the Americans a 2 @-@ 0 lead .
Melissa Gonzalez added the final goal midway through the fourth period .
the shutout was the first of the tournament for the United States goalie , Jackie Briggs , who had allowed one goal in each of the first three victories .
she is on a roll .
so is Bam .
&quot; we &apos;re in a good place right now , &quot; Parnham said , but just how good it is will depend on the result of Saturday &apos;s game .
the Depressing Food of the Depression , in &quot; A Square Meal &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after ascending to the presidency , Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down to lunch in the Oval Office .
a gourmand , President Roosevelt had a taste for fancy Fifth Avenue foods like pâté de foie gras and Maryland terrapin soup .
his menu that day was more humble : deviled eggs in tomato sauce , mashed potatoes and , for dessert , prune pudding .
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with the people who were suffering , &quot; Jane Ziegelman said .
her husband , Andrew Coe , added , &quot; It was also a message to Americans about how to eat . &quot;
the couple , who live in Brooklyn Heights , are food historians .
Mr. Coe &apos;s last book , &quot; Chop Suey , &quot; was about Chinese cuisine in America , while Ms. Ziegelman told the story of life in a Lower East Side tenement through food in her book &quot; 97 Orchard . &quot;
their new , collaborative work , &quot; A Square Meal , &quot; which will be published Tuesday by Harper , is a history of American food in the Great Depression .
showing some culinary solidarity of their own , they met a reporter for dinner at Eisenberg &apos;s Sandwich Shop , a tiny no @-@ frills lunch counter in the Flatiron district that has been in business since the year of the crash , 1929 .
Ms. Ziegelman , 54 , ordered a cream cheese and chopped olive sandwich , while Mr. Coe , 57 , had the turkey , mashed potatoes and vegetable medley .
when a reporter ordered meatloaf , the couple deemed it fitting for a discussion of Depression @-@ era eating .
&quot; loaves were very popular , &quot; Ms. Ziegelman said .
there was peanut loaf , liver loaf , bean loaf .
they were made from an ingredient and a cheap thing that stretches the ingredient out .
imagine eating enough peanuts to serve as your dinner .
Mr. Coe grimaced .
&quot; it must have sat in your stomach like lead , &quot; he said .
in the years before the Depression , the American table , especially in rural areas , was an all @-@ you @-@ can @-@ eat buffet .
teams of women cooked for male farmworkers , and fresh @-@ baked pie was served at breakfast , lunch and dinner .
it was Americans who had sent food to starving Europeans during World War I. &quot; A Square Meal &quot; chronicles the ways the nation coped with suddenly not being the land of plenty .
&quot; this was a time when food became a central , fraught subject for the American people , &quot; Mr. Coe said , explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it .
equally fraught was the new budget diet : mystery dishes like loaves and casseroles became staples , the casserole a &quot; wonderful way to repurpose leftovers , &quot; Ms. Ziegelman noted , because cooks could hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy coating of sauce .
fresh fruit was replaced with cheaper dried fruit .
meat , for years the center of the American meal , became a sparingly apportioned luxury .
strange mashups were tried as caloric and nutritional fulfillment took precedent over taste or even common kitchen sense .
in researching the book , which includes recipes , Ms. Ziegelman prepared a period dish of baked onion stuffed with peanut butter .
&quot; it was not a popular addition to the dinner table , &quot; Mr. Coe said .
Ms. Ziegelman amplified : &quot; it was surreal . &quot;
peanut butter has nothing to say to a baked onion .
it was characteristic of a lot of the home @-@ ec recipes .
as never before or since , home economists - among them Louise Stanley , chief of the federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - drove the country &apos;s eating habits .
publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; budgeteers &quot; and rise to the challenge of transforming glop like creamed spaghetti with carrots into tasty dishes .
&quot; a Square Meal &quot; is a feast of historical tidbits .
especially savory are the accounts of the government &apos;s response to its hungry citizenry , like President Herbert Hoover &apos;s let @-@ me @-@ eat @-@ cake attitude .
while he publicly praised the simple Iowa farmhouse cooking of his childhood , he dined like the millionaire sophisticate he had become .
&quot; he liked to eat Continental cuisine , like fish with cucumber sauce , &quot; Mr. Coe said .
he ate in almost a gold @-@ plated dining room , wearing a dinner jacket .
he was fabulously out of touch .
President Roosevelt may have committed the same error if his wife , Eleanor , had not encouraged him to set an example with his stomach .
as the book tells it , Mrs. Roosevelt &apos;s hiring of a housekeeper with no interest in flavor resulted in a White House that &quot; put out not only some of the dreariest food in Washington but also some of the most dismally prepared . &quot;
many of the Depression @-@ era food ways were abandoned as soon as the country got back on its feet .
the legacy is in our continued focus on calories and nutrition , Ms. Ziegelman said , and on the way science has been applied to cooking .
the couple said that in writing the book , they gained greater understanding of the eating habits of Ms. Ziegelman &apos;s mother - how she couldn &apos;t throw food away , for instance .
&quot; she had a real fear of food waste , &quot; Mr. Coe said .
Ms. Ziegelman recalled : &quot; she actually got people sick . &quot;
there was the cream @-@ puff incident .
after the plates were cleared at Eisenberg &apos;s , she and Mr. Coe pulled out a dessert they had prepared at home : the prune dessert that President Roosevelt ate for lunch .
&quot; it &apos;s called prune whip , &quot; Ms. Ziegelman said , adding that a common trick was to give modest recipes a snazzy name .
there was no whipped cream , just prunes , a little bit of flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
everyone reluctantly dipped a spoon into the viscous brown goo .
surprisingly , it wasn &apos;t bad .
Mr. Coe went back for seconds , and thirds .
sounding like a can @-@ do budgeter , he told his wife , &quot; Some chopped walnuts would help . &quot;
unfortunately , OPEC &apos;s latest monthly report shows that the crude oil production in July continued to increase and Saudi Arabia &apos;s output hit a new high .
the report cannot prevent the market from doubting the credibility of OPEC . oil recovery path is still bristled with thorns .
on Monday , OPEC Chairman and Qatar Energy Minister Sada said OPEC will hold an informal meeting during the International Energy Forum on September 26 @-@ 28 .
the monthly report of OPEC on Wednesday showed that the output of the entire OPEC organization in July , including Gabon , increased by 46,000 barrels / day to 33.11 million barrels / day .
OPEC also said in a monthly report that low crude oil prices have prompted global refiners to produce more refined oil , thus increasing the degree of excess supply to the market .
affected by this news , coupled with the production output expectations of rising crude oil and the unexpected increase in crude oil inventories , aggravating the excessive market supply .
as of Wednesday &apos;s close , the light crude oil futures of New York Mercantile Exchange fell by 2.48 % in September and the future price of crude oil in October in London Brent fell by 2.07 % .
Reuters believes that the proposed meeting of the oil @-@ producing countries is unlikely to tighten the supply . the data released by US Energy Information Administration also suppress the market sentiment .
Iran &apos;s official news agency Fars on Wednesday , quoting the speech of Zanganeh , Iranian oil minister , said that Iran &apos;s daily crude oil production was up to 3.85 million barrels , which has been the highest level since 2008 .
at the release of the news of the meeting , the Russian energy minister Novak said that it was unnecessary to conduct a new round of frozen production negotiations under the current oil price .
it was April when the oil @-@ producing countries had meeting . no agreement was reached among the OPEC member countries .
Emma Richards , an oil and gas analyst at BMIResearch , said the market and the media could react excessively to OPEC &apos;s meeting .
Helima Croft , head of commodity strategy at Royal Bank of Canada , said OPEC changed the market sentiment by releasing signals that they would make an agreement .
this means like a smoke and a mirror that draws people &apos;s attention ( deliberately giving a false impression ) .
Eugen Weinberg , director of commodity research at the German commercial bank , said the possibility of OPEC trying to stabilize the market through the September meeting was low .
this is likely to further undermine the market confidence in OPEC . after all , this organization already staged a &quot; wolf is coming . &quot;
all localities should take medical institutions which have illegal medical advertising , complaints focusing on the past and have repeatedly been punished as a focus of inspection .
national Health Commission and the State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine will timely carry out supervision on the supervision and inspection work of some provinces .
according to media disclosure , the large influx of capital into the Internet medicine has resulted in the serious problem of current product homogeneity . investment boom fade gradually and capital came into the wait @-@ and @-@ see period .
according to the data of Hong Kong Ai Li Pi Hospital Management Research Center , a large number of start @-@ up Internet medical companies languished just within one year and about 20 % of the start @-@ up Internet medical companies has ceased to exist .
however , just as the majority of Internet medical companies struggle in the road of A round or B round of financing , several sub @-@ areas leading enterprises can still get the capital touted .
it seems that the Internet medical business shall not &quot; swarm , &quot; but to see the needs of the market , and be professional and profound .
YuYue invested 12 million yuan , accounting for 40 % of the registered capital , while Jiuzhoutong invested 18 million yuan , accounting for 60 % of the registered capital .
in recent years , with the country providing policy support in the medical information , electronic and integrated supply chain management system gradually enter the hospitals at all levels .
the cooperation between Yuyue and Jiuzhoutong is aimed at the needs of the market , helping the hospital to build advanced supply chain management system , and take this opportunity to seek more cooperation .
unlike many Internet medical companies which go in for grandiose projects , iBaby focuses on the Internet obstetrics vertical field and be professional on pregnant mothers and doctors .
pregnant women can not only enjoy 24 hours of medical services free of charge and one @-@ on @-@ one inquiry with doctors , but also pay for medical counseling .
at the doctor &apos;s side , iBaby breaks the geographical restrictions by taking the form of organizing experts to give grassroots doctors an online lecture , peer exchange , case discussion and so on .
at present , three plates are set up for doctor &apos;s client side , respectively , for doctors to continue education , social exchange and communication .
the following services are provided , including online learning , case discussion and academic exchange ; social platform for the exchange of doctors of the same hospital and department ; legal assistance , business support and other services required by doctor @-@ patient relationship or personal life .
according to media reports , CEO Wang Lei recently said Ali health &quot; is willing to get down &quot; to win big health data .
Internet companies and data companies are short of professionalism . no unity can be provided on the same entry .
the layout of Ali in the medical and health field is divided into three plates , namely , Ali Health , Lynx Pharmacy and Alipay future hospital .
Wang Lei admitted that it was more difficult for medical and health companies to start up than other industries , &quot; This is not just how much money you have . in addition , it requires people to be concentrated on it and endure the loneliness .
staying up late watching the Olympic Games will damage the heart easily
Brazil Olympic Games is in full swing . even if the event is broadcast in the midnight in China , many people will stay up late to watch .
in this regard , the doctor reminded that staying up late has health risks and may lead to cardiovascular disease .
if you stay up for a long time , the hormone will have a lot of secretion and your body will continue to be in a state of intense excitement and cannot have normal recovery . this may easily cause vasoconstriction , blood pressure and thus cardiovascular disease .
Han Zhiyuan reminded people who have high blood pressure , high blood sugar , high blood lipids , smoking habits , family history and other cardiovascular risk factors may easily suffer from cardiovascular disease if staying up late .
if you stay up late , then your cardiovascular function will be affected , your gastrointestinal function , immune system , neuroendocrine system will also be affected , and even the risk of cancer will increase .
for old friends , Han Zhiyuan suggested them better not stay up late to watch games , particularly those with cardiovascular disease .
during the last &quot; World Cup &quot; football match , Han Zhiyuan received a 60 @-@ year @-@ old patient . his onset of myocardial infarction may be related with staying up late to watch games .
according to Han Zhiyuan , his department had treated some 25 @-@ year @-@ old myocardial infarction or stroke patients . this is largely due to long @-@ term stay up of patients .
1 . do not stay up late every day . you can occasionally stay up all night watching the favorite sports and watch the rebroadcast for other sports next day .
2 . you may drink more water , have more fruit during stay up as this can prevent blood clogging and enhance your body immunity .

on August 11 , the Armed Police Shandong Corps Yantai detachment organized special war snipers to have jungle training at Kunyu Mountain under the high temperature of 34 degrees Celsius .
during the Cold War , the Soviet Union transported the missile into Cuba , which almost led to the US @-@ Soviet nuclear war .
this event was seen as the pinnacle of the cold war , known as the &quot; Cuban missile crisis . &quot;
but what is little known is that during the Cold War , a strong solar storm has almost led to a nuclear war of the United States against the Soviet Union . the incident has not been announced by the researchers until August 9 .
on May 23 , 1967 , a strong solar storm caused strong interference to the radar and radio communications of the US military in the Arctic .
these radars were part of the ballistic missile early warning system of the US , used for monitoring Soviet missiles .
this paper was written by researchers at the University of Colorado , who interviewed US military personnel involved in the forecasting and analysis of solar activity and reviewed non @-@ confidential documents .
the paper wrote that in the 1960s , in order to prevent the Soviet Union from suddenly launching nuclear war , the US Air Force has always had some fighters with nuclear warheads flying in the sky .
us military commanders did not know that the culprit of the interference was the solar storm rather than the Soviet Union , so they ordered the fighters to enter combat readiness state .
fortunately , the US military force had started the study of solar activities and its electromagnetic interference to the Earth since the 1950s , it ultimately stopped this potential military conflict .
later , he summarized the information provided by the US Air Force Air Meteorological Service and submitted a detailed report .
the direct consequence of this solar storm is that the US military has seen space weather as a combat concern and has built a stronger space weather forecast system .
during daily travel , when citizens found that their cars were hampered by a strange vehicle , they may use &quot; WeChat vehicle moving &quot; function to solve this problem when they failed to contact with the strange vehicle driver .

on April 27 , 2015 , the United States and Japan jointly issued a new version of &quot; US @-@ Japan defense cooperation guidelines &quot; in New York , allowing the Japanese armed forces to play a more offensive role in the world .
this is the day the US Defense Secretary Carter , US Secretary of State Kerry , Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida and Japan &apos;s Minister of Defense Gen Nakatani attended the press conference in New York .
this is the fifth time that China &apos;s civilian think tank has published the Japanese military assessment report and the fourth launch of the English version .
the report is divided into nine chapters , including the overall policy adjustment , military strength , defense budget , military deployment , weapons and equipment , military system reform , military training , foreign military security cooperation and military security relations with China and so on .
the report said that the year 2015 is a phased last year of the Abe government to promote major policy adjustments in the security area .

British &quot; Financial Times &quot; on August 12 released a group of pictures on mansion of US ambassador to China .
according to the article , in contrast , the appearance of the American ambassador &apos;s residence , from the appearance of view , can be used as safety house in the cold war spy novels of John le Carré .
the residence is gray , and strongly fortified by peripheral fence , the second interior wall , barbed wire entanglement and vehicle roadblocks .
improvement of public sports facilities
dark coal field warehouse is turned into a &quot; green grass &quot; football field while red brick spire plant is turned into a modern sports museum .
on the national fitness day , Nanluo Maying Sports Culture Park , outside the Hangzhou Wangjiang gate , unveiled its mysterious veil .
it was a coal field once and remained idle for more than 10 years after its closure . a large number of illegal construction and garbage were left behind .
after the renovation , it became a sports and cultural park , and will be officially opened in November to the public free of charge to provide sports venues . in addition , it would undoubtedly open up a new fertile soil for the whole people .
this reminds people of Hangzhou Chen Jinglun School . this is a &quot; Whampoa Military Academy &quot; in China &apos;s swimming world , in which several world champions were born .
swimming champions will be produced continuously , producing a vivid interpretation of the relationship between competitive sports and national sports . the profound mass base provided a good condition for selecting professional players .
the level of competitive sports is closely related to the foundation of national sports . athletic sports depend in a certain sense on national sports , and national sports depend on the conditions of the site .
according to reports , as of 2015 , the area of China &apos;s per capita sports venues has been 150 times of that when the new China was established , but still far behind the sports power .
in June this year , the State Council issued a &quot; National Fitness Program ( 2016 - 2020 ) &quot; and took the development of mass sports as a key content .
in order to fill the short board , on the one hand , the relevant departments shall take full account of the layout of the stadium at urban planning .
on the other hand , the already built public sports venues , including schools and other units in the sports venues , should try to expand the scope of openness and try to improve efficiency as much as possible .
the Rio Olympic Games , which is in full swing , has stimulated people &apos;s enthusiasm for sports , but also aroused everyone &apos;s awareness of participation .
Gilead to get attorney fees in hepatitis C patent fight with Merck
Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to receive the attorney fees it incurred related to hepatitis C patent litigation with drugmaker Merck &amp; Co Inc , a U.S. district judge has ruled .
in June , Gilead was freed from paying up $ 200 million in damages for infringing two Merck patents related to Gilead &apos;s blockbuster drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni , after a U.S. judge found a pattern of misconduct by Merck including lying under oath and other unethical practices .
in a filing on Thursday , U.S. District Judge Beth Labson Freeman said that Gilead was entitled to relief from the fees it incurred while defending the case .
Merck is trying to catch up to Gilead , which dominates the market on a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure well over 90 percent of patients with the liver disease .
the case dates back to 2013 when Gilead and Merck sued each other , claiming ownership of laboratory work underlying sofosbuvir , the active ingredient in Gilead &apos;s drugs .
U.S. backed forces say they have seized full control of Manbij from Islamic State
U.S.-backed forces have seized full control of northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border after the last remaining Islamic State fighters inside the city left , a spokesman for the group said on Friday .
Syria Democratic Forces ( SDF ) were now sweeping the city after the departure of a remaining group of militants who had been holed up in the city .
they had freed over 2,000 civilian hostages who had been held by the militants , Sharfan Darwish of the SDF allied Manbij Military Council told Reuters .
&quot; the city is now fully under our control but we are undertaking sweeping operations , &quot; he told Reuters .
Clintons earned $ 10.75 million in 2015 , paid 34.2 percent federal tax rate
Hillary Clinton on Friday released her 2015 tax returns , which showed the Democratic presidential nominee and her husband had $ 10.75 million in income that year and paid an effective federal tax rate of 34.2 percent .
in 2015 , the Clintons made $ 1 million in charitable contributions , mostly to the Clinton Foundation ; former President Bill Clinton brought in nearly $ 5.3 million in speaking fees ; and the former secretary of state reported income of $ 3 million from publisher Simon &amp; Schuster for her book on her tenure at the State Department .
Clinton &apos;s running mate , U.S. Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia , along with his wife , Anne Holton , released 10 years of tax returns .
they paid a federal effective tax rate of 20.3 percent in 2015 .
&quot; Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set the standard for financial transparency , &quot; Clinton campaign aide Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement .
in stark contrast , Donald Trump is hiding behind fake excuses and backtracking on his previous promises to release his tax returns .
it is customary for U.S. presidential candidates to make their tax returns public , although they are not required by law to do so .
Trump , a New York businessman , and his lawyers have cited an audit by the Internal Revenue Service as a reason for his refusal to release his returns .
&quot; your move , &quot; Clinton campaign aide Ian Sams said on Twitter , linking to the Democratic nominee &apos;s returns .
on Thursday , Trump &apos;s special counsel , Michael Cohen , told CNN he would not allow Trump to release them until the audits are complete .
Trump &apos;s critics , including 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other fellow Republicans , have said his refusal raises questions about his net worth , his charitable contributions , his business dealings and various other ties , including with Russia .
Clinton has pounced on the issue , releasing an online video on Friday highlighting high @-@ profile Republicans urging Trump to release his taxes .
on Thursday , she raised the issue during an economic speech in Michigan .
&quot; he refuses to do what every other presidential candidate in decades has done and release his tax returns , &quot; she told the crowd .
politico has reported that Trump paid zero to very little taxes for two years in the 1990s , and a New York Times business columnist on Friday quoted a number of tax lawyers and accountants saying that could still be the case .
Federal tax rates have become an issue in the presidential election .
Clinton has endorsed a rule named after billionaire investor Warren Buffett that would ensure those making more than $ 1 million a year pay a tax rate of at least 30 percent .
President Barack Obama also backs the proposal .
at a Clinton rally last week in Omaha , Nebraska , Buffett , whose Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate is based there , challenged Trump to meet and exchange tax returns .
buffet said that he too was under IRS audit and Trump is &quot; afraid &quot; not of the tax @-@ collection agency but of voters .
Clinton &apos;s campaign has released tax returns going back to 2007 .
the Clintons , who now live in Chappaqua , New York , paid an average effective federal tax rate of about 32 percent from 2007 to 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approximately 40.5 percent .
the Clintons &apos; 2015 return showed that , unlike most Americans , just $ 100 of their income came from wages .
their main investment was a low @-@ cost index mutual fund , and the Clintons reported dividend and interest income of $ 109,000 .

Jewish filmmaker slams Berlin hotel for removing Israel dial code after Arab &quot; request &quot; - RT News
a French filmmaker of Jewish origin unleashed a media furor after he revealed that the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin does not list Israel &apos;s dial code , with employee citing &quot; requests &quot; from Arabic customers .
Claude Lanzmann , an author of Holocaust documentary &quot; Shoah , &quot; vented his frustration at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin , writing an open letter in the German outlet FAZ .
during his recent stay , Lanzmann tried to find Israel in the list of dial codes provided by the hotel .
the country however was not mentioned among the states one can call directly from the room .
how is it possible , in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , that Israel was eliminated and eradicated ?
Lanzmann wrote .
instead , Kempinski Bristol offers an opportunity to dial Israel via an own call center .
seeking explanation , the filmmaker addressed the issue at the hotel &apos;s reception .
the answer he got there , Lanzmann wrote &quot; shocked him . &quot;
the hotel &apos;s clerk said that the measure was &quot; a deliberate decision by the management of Kempinski @-@ Hotels . &quot;
the reason behind the move triggered even more outrage by the filmmaker .
&quot; the majority of our guests are Arabs and they demanded Israel &apos;s code to be deleted , &quot; the employee was quoted as saying by Lanzmann .
Israeli ambassador to Germany Yakov Hadas @-@ Handelsman called the case a &quot; great shame , &quot; Suddeutsche Zeitung reports .
we were appalled and shocked by the incident .
it is in itself a great shame .
the fact that it has occurred in Germany and at that very hotel chain , is an even greater disgrace .
that needs no explanation .
we expect that the hotel draws the right conclusions , &quot; the official said .
the incident triggered quite a response online , with people calling it a scandal .
some alleged that the Kempinski hotel simply &quot; caved in &quot; to the alleged demands of Arabic customers .
&quot; shame on you , &quot; another post stated , pointing out that the hotel , located in the noble Kurfurstendamm street stands near a synagogue .
the hotel itself was quick to brush off any accusations , calling what happened an &quot; oversight &quot; and &quot; apologizing &quot; to Lanzmann , Der Spiegel reports .
&quot; there was never a direct order &quot; not to include Israel in the fast dial list , &quot; Suddeutsche Zeitung quoted a Kempinski representative as saying .
it adds that the code was now added .
police use tear gas &amp; rubber bullets against protesting Brazilian students
students clashed with police in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo on Thursday as they gathered to demonstrate against government reforms to the public education system .
police used tear gas and rubber bullets against the protesters .
the trouble started when law enforcement officers tried to disperse the students , which led to the police using rubber bullets and tear gas .
several hundred students took part in the demonstration to express their dismay at the plans .
under proposals from the governor of the state of Sao Paulo Geraldo Alckmin , just under 100 public schools will be closed , while 300,000 students will be relocated in order to save money .
some of those taking part in the protest could be seen writing graffiti on the walls against the interim President Michel Temer .
this latest protest comes just days after protesters took to the streets en masse to support suspended President Dilma Rousseff as the country &apos;s senate voted for her impeachment .
Scot Callum Skinner storms home as Brits grab cycling gold
Scotland &apos;s Callum Skinner raced to glory in the men &apos;s team sprint at the Rio velodrome last night as the Team GB trio defended the title from London 2012 .
the Glaswegian 23 @-@ year @-@ old was in the anchor role that his fellow Scotsman Sir Chris Hoy made his own and the youngster did the legend proud as he stormed home to snatch victory from the favoured New Zealand outfit .
Britain claimed a shock victory four years ago to win as Hoy claimed the fifth of his six Olympic golds .
and they repeated the trick after finishing a lowly sixth at March &apos;s Track World Championships in London , despite Hoy having since retired .
the issue between Beijing and London was replacing specialist starter Jamie Staff .
they did so just in time as Hindes emerged .
Hoy &apos;s retirement also created a void which Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill .
Skinner was the man Britain &apos;s coaches stuck with , seeing potential in the Scot which has now been realised .
Hindes , Kenny - champions with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner set an Olympic record in qualifying , but the standard was overtaken by New Zealand in the first round .
and the British trio won the duel for gold .
Hindes was narrowly behind after his lap , but Kenny pushed the team in front and Skinner held on .
a change of strategy was a big part of the transformation , with Hindes riding a bigger gear to slow him down and allow Kenny and , in particular , Skinner to keep pace .
Hoy watched on from his position as a BBC pundit and caught the eye of Skinner , Kenny and Hindes when they stepped on to the podium .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Skinner , from Glasgow , said : &quot; it &apos;s a flattering comparison . &quot;
I &apos;m just out there to do my best and make a name for myself .
we set an Olympic record in the final and beat the world champions .
it was just incredible .
there &apos;s no better way to win it .
after triumphing at London 2012 alongside Kenny and Hoy , Hindes admitted to deliberately falling to the track following a poor start .
he later retracted the comment and there was no method of appeal from Britain &apos;s rivals .
there was no such issue this time around in a supreme victory .
Hindes said : &quot; it felt like London , with all the GB flags in the stand . &quot;
we all as a team came together in the last three months .
we &apos;ve been losing out on so many world titles , so to win the Olympics again is just amazing .
that is one event , one gold medal for the nation which won seven out of 10 track titles in both Beijing and London .
if that is a barometer of the progress made in the last five months , then a successful five days in the velodrome awaits .
with the form Kenny demonstrated , it is not beyond the realms of possibility to imagine him repeating Hoy &apos;s feat of winning three Olympic golds in one Games .
that would see Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy , who is also born on 23 March ( that seemingly sacred date in British sport which is also the birthday of Steve Redgrave , Mo Farah and Roger Bannister ) - take his tally to six gold medals and one silver .
that would be the same as Hoy &apos;s .
Kenny next competes in the sprint , which begins on today and plays out over three days .
the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bolton said : &quot; I &apos;m just enjoying this one for now .
the team event is always the best .
you get to win it with your mates .
it &apos;s a bit lonely winning on your own to be honest .
Hindes said : &quot; if he wins another two gold medals , he should get a knighthood . &quot;
it was the day &apos;s only medal event , but there was further good news for Britain .
sir Bradley Wiggins , Ed Clancy , Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified fastest in the four @-@ man , four @-@ kilometres team pursuit .
they finished in 3 : 51.943 .
the world record , set in winning gold at London 2012 , is 3 : 51.659 .
the first round and final ( 10.42pm ) take place on today &apos;s second day of action , where Wiggins is sure to be the focus .
he had a dispute with commissaires yesterday ahead of the qualification ride , when officials summoned him to measure his height .
in the corresponding women &apos;s event , which resumes and concludes tomorrow , Laura Trott , Joanna Rowsell Shand , Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie advanced in a world record time , clocking 4 : 13.260 .
team GB have come to rely on its mighty track cycling squad to take ownership of the middle period of an Olympic Games and deliver a host of medals .
after truly exceptional showings of utter dominance at Beijing and London , expectations have been played down in the lead @-@ up to Rio .
there have been dramas in the background , not least the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April amid sexism and bullying allegations , and the retirements of giant figures like Hoy and Victoria Pendleton .
however , on the evidence of the first night &apos;s racing in the velodrome , it looks like GB &apos;s now legendary reputation for peaking at the perfect time could be about to be repeated once again .
after the little baby came to this world , Mom and Dad shall be responsible for his life , not only for his health , but also for the development of his spirit , that is , education .
if such education failed , then no matter how successful your career is , you cannot make up for the shortcomings of life and family failure .
when a new baby is born , the new dad and mom need to spend time in taking care of and educating him , and be responsible for him .
and responsibility is not only reflected in the care of body , making them healthy , but also the education of spirit . that is , to make children learn how to behave , grow up and succeed .
good family education means that parents often need to accompany their children , to take care of them patiently and teach them develop a civilized behavior and make them learn knowledge better and enhance intelligence .
parents &apos; words and deeds will affect the growth of their children because they will imitate their parents . and that is the so called , &quot; like father , like son . &quot; your son will be the same as you .
so we need to be a good example in front of children , regulate our words , cultivate our characters , which will indirectly help children shape their own excellent character , so that he will become more excellent .
Amy is a smart and pretty girl .
she is outgoing and can get along well with friends . in addition , she can adapts to the environment quite well .
but Amy has a little secret in her heart : she cannot concentrate long on what she wants to do and works on .
this secret is accompanied by Amy for a long time . usually the problem is not serious .
even though she learns and works in decentralized , modular , she can complete the task basically , and achieve good results .
however , when the task is heavy and pressing , Amy feels very painful and tortured .
the individual &apos;s resistance to self @-@ exposure and his emotional experience is to prevent the individual &apos;s self @-@ awareness and self @-@ esteem from threatening .
and some behaviorist psychologists understand the impedance as an individual &apos;s disobedience to their behavioral corrections .
I tried to let Amy do an exercise , let her breathe through the way to calm down and feel the torment .
and once he left the trapped situation , she felt relaxed and regained freedom .
the current 63 @-@ year @-@ old wanderer Han and another tramp Xiao had a dispute after alcohol drinking . then Han stabbed Xiao to death with a fruit knife .

4 years after Uber joined the Taiwan market , it caused no small impact on the local traditional taxi industry .
according to the information of Taiwan &quot; United Daily News &quot; on August 12 , more than 100 taxies bypassed Taiwan Executive Yuan for protest . this resulted in serious traffic paralysis in the surrounding area .
it has been four years since the arrival of Uber in Taiwan , but the authority just launched the meeting at the end of this month . drivers cannot wait any more , said Zheng Lijia , the chairman of Taipei Driver Union .
however , the government eat their words and delayed again and again .
the law @-@ abiding taxi drivers , who are at the bottom of the society , had to compete with the unrestrained Uber and felt deceived by the authorities .
original title : the Owner of A Jiangsu Farm Was Punished Because He Disposed of The 2,000 Chicken Without Permission Which Were Checked And Detained By The Court
after the verdict comes into effect , because Lee did not automatically fulfill the obligation to determine the verdict , Wang apply for enforcement to the Shuyang court .
on October 16 , 2014 , Shuyang court made a civil ruling , and ruled that all of the 2,000 farm laying hens shall only be seized and shall not be transferred and sold without permission .
after Lee received the detention ruling , without the permission of the Shuyang court , he privately sold partial egg laying hens .
until March 8 , 2015 when Shuyang County Public Security Bureau conducted a survey , there were only 142 layers on the farm .
on August 12 , reporters was informed that the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics and the Winter Paralympic Organizing Committee issued a notice that the Beijing Winter Olympic Organizing Committee inherited the emblem and signs of Beijing Olympic Winter Games for commercial purposes .
without the permission of the Beijing Winter Olympic Organizing Committee , no one shall use the emblem and signs of Beijing Olympic Winter Games for commercial purposes .
the head of the Department of Industrial Coordination of the National Development and Reform Commission said that iron and steel overcapacity is now a global problem .
China &apos;s capacity utilization in recent years is higher than the global average , but also higher than that of the United States and Europe and other countries and regions .
China has taken resolute and effective measures to resolve excess capacity , and the results are gradually emerging .
the official pointed out that the CPC Central Committee and State Council should attach great importance to the global problem of iron and steel overcapacity .
all departments and regions should actively implement the deployment of the State Council , earnestly carry out the work , and reduce crude steel production capacity by 45 million tons this year .
from China &apos;s national conditions , China does not encourage steel exports . on the contrary , it also takes a series of practical measures to control steel exports .
the person in charge stressed that the international trade of iron and steel products is essentially a market behavior and an independent choice from the requirement of importing countries and after considering the product cost and other factors .
the implementation of trade protection measures does not help to fundamentally solve the global steel industry development issues . on the contrary , it will only cause further impact on the international trade order .
when it comes to debt , the person in charge stressed that the resolution of the debt problem is to properly handle the important issues that need proper handling .
as the iron and steel enterprises are large @-@ scale and involve a wide range of enterprises , the debt relationship is complex . it may lead to regional risks if disposed of improperly .
according to the person in charge , in recent years , with the economic downward pressure to increase , the total social demand gradually weakened , part of the industry capacity utilization decreased and enterprise production and management difficulties increased .
some enterprises do not meet the changes in the market environment and the production and management is difficult to sustain or even on the brink of collapse . but restrained by some institutional factors , they become &quot; zombie enterprises &quot; due to many obstacles to the market .
the existence of these companies distorted market signal , reduced the elements resources use efficiency , increased the cost of social management , thereby hindering the establishment of market environment with fair competition .
the main reason for the loss is the same as the dilemma faced by the global steel industry - weak market demand and low utilization rate .
China mainly adopts the market mechanism , economic means and the rule of law . the government is mainly to do the work of disclosing the ins and outs to workers and social stability , to ensure fair and equitable market order .
the person in charge stressed that the next step is to do a good job to ensure overcapacity cutting and ensuring the objective of resolving 100 million tons @-@ 150 million tons of crude steel production capacity within five years .
in the afternoon of the 10th day of the month , the appearance of Chinese tourist police in the Red Square in Moscow immediately drew people &apos;s attention . Chinese tourists waved with surprise , and the local people and foreign tourists cannot help but to stop looking back .
on the same day , China &apos;s first professional travel police team - members of Tourism Police Detachment , Sanya City , Hainan Province Public Security Bureau came to the Red Square in Moscow , and communicated with the local police on duty .
Moscow travel police are divided into three groups for duty patrol in the Red Square , Nicolieski pedestrian street and Gu Mu Department Store . the Chinese tourist police also followed for study . the whole process lasted more than an hour .
female police officer Liu Xinie is 20 @-@ plus years old , proficient in English and Spanish . she just joined the tourism police team last year .
he carefully observed every word and action of the Russian counterparts and communicated with her from time to time .
when he saw Spanish tourists come for consultation , the Moscow travel police explained to him with fluent Spanish , which impressed Wang Bing .
&quot; every Moscow travel policeman master foreign language , and some even can speak more than two languages , which impressed us a lot . &quot;
&quot; Hainan , as an international tourist island , is gradually paying attention to attract international tourists . we hope to improve their ability to match the status of international tourism island . &quot;
on the current day before the study , the Chinese tourist police also went to the brigade station of Moscow city police to communicate with their Russian counterparts .
&quot; I often deal with Chinese tourists and I am very happen to see them travel to Russia . &quot;
&quot; their usual questions are : where is xxx , for example , where is a monument , how to rent a taxi and how to return to the hotel . &quot;
Lei Sakov , the brigade captain of Moscow city police said that in recent years , Moscow &apos;s urban environment and tourism ambience have become better and better , attracting more and more foreign tourists .
in order to meet the needs of tourism development , it set up a tourist police team in July 2014 , responsible for patrol in the major scenic spots , thus helping and diverting the tourists .
at present , all Moscow tourist policemen are proficient in English and some also master Spanish and German .
the police brigade divided them into nine groups according to their foreign language levels . they have two classes per week , learn self @-@ defense moves , laws and regulations and foreign languages .
&quot; at present , there are two tourist police beginning to learn Chinese and they can speak fluently . we have to continue to improve their Chinese level , &quot; Lysakov said .
Lysakov told reporters that the Moscow Tourism Police since its inception , have accumulated a certain amount of experience and hoped to inspire counterparts in Sanya .
he believes that the cooperation between the Russian and Chinese police departments will enhance the security sense of their citizens to each other &apos;s national tourism .
&quot; the recruiting , police mode and equipment of Moscow tour police officers and their excellent interactions with visitors have brought us a lot of inspiration . &quot; Chen Xiaokun said .
Chinanews journalist found that there are at least nine provinces and cities issuing rules for the implementation of residence permit , including Hebei , Jilin , Tianjin , Jiangxi , Sichuan , Hainan , Gansu , Fujian and Beijing , etc .
for the conditions of applying for residence permit , the above regions generally said that the applicants need to live more than six months and meet one of these three requirements : having legitimate and stable employment , having legal and stable residence and continuous study .
Chinanews journalist noted that in the aspect of residence permit providing treatment , the &quot; gold content &quot; is different in various cities . compared with the national provisions , some areas have provided more public services and conveniences .
these areas have increased the conveniences of children to attend college entrance examination in the local place while meeting the related requirement .
in addition , it is clearly proposed by Beijing and other places that they will gradually expand the scope of public services and convenience , and regularly release to the community .
for example , Fujian proposed to announce the public services and convenience of residence permit holders to the public at least every 3 years
&quot; residence Permit Provisional Regulations &quot; provides that , for those in line with the residence permit conditions , the public security organs shall issue a residence permit within 15 days from the date of acceptance .
for the time limit , most of the region hold the same opinion with the national version . that is , to release the permit within 15 days .
Hebei clearly stipulates that for applicants who meet the conditions of application and have complete application documents , the residence police station shall issue a residence permit within 3 working days from the date of acceptance .
Jiangxi clearly stipulates that for applicants who meet the conditions of application and have complete application documents , the public security shall issue a residence permit within 5 working days from the date of acceptance .
in accordance with the &quot; residence permit provisional regulations , &quot; the above cities stipulate clearly that the cost of certificate production shall be exempted in case of initial application of residence permit .
for example , Sichuan required the local police stations or commissioned community service agencies shall strictly enforce the approved fees and charges standard and resolutely prohibit over @-@ range , over @-@ standard fees or ride fees .
it was found that on July 27 , 2016 , Chen Yangxia , the former Ganzhou City Dingnan County Party Secretary came to the Provincial Commission for Discipline Inspection for reporting and serving as director of the CPC supervision room ( deputy director @-@ general , one year &apos;s probation period ) .
the red wine at the dinner was provided by Li Youcai while other costs were borne by Liu .
Jiangxi Provincial Commission for Discipline Inspection informed that Chen Yangxia and Cheng Ziliang , who organized and accepted dining invitation in private clubs , violated the spirit of the central eight provisions and the Party &apos;s discipline .
last season , Pogba was punished with two yellow cards . he will be banned automatically according to the rules .
although he has transferred back to the Premiership , the Football Association Challenge Cup ( FA Cup ) still passes his accumulative suspension to FA Cup .
in this way , on August 14 , in the away games of fighting against Bournemouth , Pogba will watch a fight without helping any party . his first show after return to Manchester United will be extended to Southampton &apos;s home game on August 20 .
as the No.12 new arrival of the first round in 2014 , Salic will officially land on the NBA in the next season , and join the Philadelphia 76ers .
as a young European player , Salic is not known to many fans . but I believe he impressed people with his performance in this Olympic Games .
in a game with win by a narrow margin of Croatian over Spain , Salici successfully blocked Paul - Gasol in his last moment and tried to drag the game into the overtime basket attack .
recently , Brett @-@ Brown , the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the 76 @-@ team gave Salic a high rating . he thought he saw the shadow of young Manu @-@ Ginobili in Saric .
it is quite obvious that Saric already showed his gift and made 76 people full of expectations .
in Croatia &apos;s first two games of the Olympic Games , Salic received a total of 24 points , 17 rebounds and 12 assists .
in the first half , Salic showed his capability of drawing space on the scene . he can have a shot outside the three @-@ point line via the pick and roll with his colleagues .
although the current 76 @-@ team is packed with many gifted young players , they are not equipped with the outside scoring capability as Salic .
from block shot to launching a long pass , fast break and complete assists , there are just a few insiders who can do it on the NBA game .
since the beginning of this Olympic Games , Salic has obtained 13 points , eight backboards and five assists in three games , with a full performance .
James has signed two 1 + 1 contracts since he decided to return to the Cavaliers in the summer of 2014 .
now , as this labor agreement is about to enter the last year , James will be in the forefront of labor negotiations as the vice chairman of NBA player union .
the substantial increase in union revenue is attributed to the new television protocol . the question is how the boss and players deal with the money . the outside world is worried that the NBA will fall in the next summer .
but for James , he will not have to worry that he will become a free agent next summer because he has renewed a 3 @-@ year contract with the Cavaliers .
no matter when the 2017 @-@ 18 season kicks off , James is within the contract .
since the stunning debut of iPhoneSE , the mobile phone market also ushered in a small screen machine boom .
not long ago , Nubia also launched the first works of its Z11 series : nubiaZ11mini .
NubiaZ11mini follows its consistent photographed gene , and is equipped with a one @-@ hand easier @-@ to @-@ hold 5.0 @-@ inch screen , portable and convenient post @-@ fingerprint recognition , contributing to its superior experience .
a small screen camera phone Z11mini , which was just listed by Nubia , had a price fall of RMB 200 , decreasing from the original RMB 1499 to RMB 1299 .
in appearance , nubiaZ11mini uses a 5 @-@ inch 1080p screen . the classic &quot; little red circle &quot; design is below on the front side .
the middle frame is metal material . its bottom adopts symmetrical design and is equipped with Type @-@ C data interface .
Portland smelter &apos;s future in doubt with axing of power contract
the future of the Portland aluminium smelter in Victoria - and the jobs of hundreds of workers - is in doubt with the power company which supplies the plant disclosing one of the plant &apos;s owners is to terminate a supply contract , with all supply contracts expected to be axed .
the move follows the decision of the Victoria government earlier this year to not extend subsidies provided to keep the plant in operation .
a 20 @-@ year fixed subsidy expires in November .
up to 2000 jobs may be at risk at Alcoa &apos;s Portland plant .
as many as 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk with any closure .
and there could be additional knock @-@ on effects since the smelter consumes around 10 per cent of Victoria &apos;s entire electricity output .
in 2014 , Alcoa closed the Point Henry smelter which led to the closure last year of the Anglesea power plant .
Alcoa &apos;s Portland smelter is losing money and risks closure .
the moves follows speculation about the future of the plant for several years now , initially in the wake of the strong Australian dollar and more recently due to the price for the output from the plant .
AGL , which supplies the big aluminium smelter with electricity from its Loy Yang A power plant in the LaTrobe Valley , said it expects the other three owners will also move to terminate their agreements .
the plant is majority owned by a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina , with China &apos;s CITIC and Japan &apos;s Marubeni Corp holding smaller shares .
&quot; AGL expects the Portland facility to continue to operate , meaning physical demand for electricity from the smelter will continue , &quot; it said .
AGL said the contracts are so @-@ called &apos; hedging contracts &apos; which were due to take effect from November 2016 .
the contracts have a 12 @-@ month termination period so they will actually finish in 2017 .
&quot; as such , AGL continues to expect the contracts to contribute to earnings in fiscal year 17 , &quot; the power company said .
any potential earnings impact on AGL from FY18 onwards is currently limited by the strong futures market outlook for wholesale electricity prices .
AGL said it had already written down the value of the contracts in its accounts by $ 187 million in &quot; anticipation of a termination event . &quot;
Alcoa said the decision to close out the contracts &quot; does not affect Alcoa &apos;s ... ability to operate the smelter or secure electricity supply to the smelter . &quot;
the US company said it entered into a 20 @-@ year contract with Loy Yang in 2010 , which was due to commence from November this year , although it has yet to explain why it has pulled out of the contract .
analysts have been wary of the possible closure of both of the Portland smelter in Victoria and also the Tomago plant near Newcastle due to the poor economics of the industry .
addressing analysts earlier in the week , AGL &apos;s head of operations , Stephen Mikkelsen said Portland uses around 600 megawatts of power annually and Tomago around 900 megawatts .
if both of those plants go from the market that &apos;s a significant reduction in demand in the &#91; electricity &#93; market .
and as a generator that wouldn &apos;t be good for us , &quot; he said .
community legal centres turn away 160,000 people a year
more than 160,000 of the nation &apos;s most vulnerable are turned away from community legal centres every year , with the sector bracing itself for the impact further funding cuts will have on already @-@ stretched operations .
in Queensland , three out of five people - mostly the elderly , immigrants , vulnerable workers , victims of violence and those without resources to fight unfair evictions and the like - are already turned away while seeking free legal advice and representation .
community legal services , already stretched beyond limits , are bracing for further cuts .
from June next year , those legal centres are slated to lose another 30 per cent of their federal funding .
Director of Community Legal Centres Queensland James Farrell said the latest National Association of Community Legal Centres Census Report found thousands of people were already being turned away each year .
Mr Farrell said without a reversal of the federal government decision , the situation was only going to get worse .
&quot; Queensland &apos;s community legal centres are chronically underfunded , meaning thousands of people are turned away from the vital services they need , &quot; he said .
people leaving violent relationships , people with unmanageable and crippling debts , families going through separation , workers who are unfairly sacked - all of these people have problems with legal dimensions , and this report shows that they &apos;re not able to get the help they need .
the federal government will cut funding by 30 per cent from June 2017 , which means thousands more vulnerable Queenslanders will be forced to navigate complex legal problems without help .
we call on the Attorney @-@ General , and Queensland Senator George Brandis to immediately reverse these funding cuts , so people can get the help they need when they &apos;re faced with a legal problem .
last year , the state government delivered on its commitment to bring legal aid funding up to the national average .
it &apos;s now time to look at the needs of community legal centres and their client communities , and for the Palaszczuk government to invest in this important work .
Donald Trump campaign sued after staffer allegedly pulled a gun
new York : Donald Trump &apos;s campaign was sued for allegedly doing nothing after being told that the director of its North Carolina operations pulled a gun on a staffer as they drove in a Jeep in February .
the incident was described in a lawsuit filed on Wednesday in state court in Charlotte by Vincent Bordini , a former software trainer for the state campaign .
Bordini said he waited for months for the situation to be handled internally before realising &quot; this was not going to happen . &quot;
the director , Earl Phillip , &quot; produced a pistol , put his right index finger on the trigger , and drove the barrel into Vincent &apos;s knee cap , &quot; Bordini said in the complaint .
after complaining to local and regional campaign leadership , Bordini learned that at least four other people had experience the same thing with Phillip , according to the filing .
&quot; guns don &apos;t have to fire to inflict damage , &quot; Bordini said in the complaint .
the suit comes just two days after the Republican presidential nominee caused a furore when telling a crowd in North Carolina that the &quot; Second Amendment people &quot; -- understood to be gun owners and gun enthusiasts -- could take action if his rival Hillary Clinton were elected and gets her pick of judges .
Trump &apos;s campaign said the media had taken his words out of context and that he wasn &apos;t advocating violence .
Bordini &apos;s complaint seeks compensation from the campaign for negligent supervision , and from Phillip for assault , battery and infliction of emotional distress .
Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks didn &apos;t immediately return a message seeking comment .
attempts to reach Phillip were unsuccessful .
WCCB , a local news affiliate in Charlotte , reported Phillip recently left the campaign .
a call left at his consulting firm , Innovative Consulting Services , wasn &apos;t immediately returned .
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has run a controversial campaign .
the case is Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc . , 16 @-@ CS @-@ 14300 , General Court of Justice , Superior Court Division County of Mecklenburg ( Charlotte ) .
Britain must channel the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will also deliver regeneration and prosperity not just in our local communities and across London , but across the country .
for me , this was the great attraction of Heathrow , just as it was with London 2012 , where we made enormous efforts to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the Games .
the Olympics achieved huge benefits for Stratford and the East End .
and , we will do so again by creating opportunities for local people and firms close to Heathrow .
for our local communities alone we &apos;ll create 10,000 new apprenticeships , 40,000 new jobs and bring an end to youth unemployment around the airport .
just as there were ahead of London 2012 , there will be those that think the challenge of Heathrow expansion is too great .
I was told that Britain would be never be ready for the Games and that we would be embarrassed on the world stage .
the doubters were wrong on 2012 and they will be proved wrong on Heathrow .
there are always obstacles to be overcome , but Heathrow is answering every question asked of it .
like the Olympics , Heathrow is an infrastructure project for the many , not just the few .
expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs , £ 211bn in economic growth , leaving a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and across the UK .
we have a great team at Heathrow who have implemented an £ 11bn programme of infrastructure investment on time and on budget , from T5 - voted the world &apos;s best airport terminal five years in a row , to T2 , built in the middle of the world &apos;s busiest two runways .
now they stand ready to deliver a third runway , backed by £ 16 billion of private investment .
the London 2012 Games were a great success for the UK and I am confident that Heathrow expansion will be too .
it is time for us to channel that Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow , securing our trading future and creating a legacy of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of .
Lord Paul Deighton is chairman of the Heathrow Board and former Commercial Secretary to the Treasury
woman run over on Swiss motorway in apparent suicide
the victim was lying on the motorway in the middle of the night .
police are appealing for witnesses after a woman was run over by several vehicles on a motorway in the early hours of Thursday in an apparent act of suicide .
the incident happened on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud just after midnight on Thursday .
a woman lay down in the dark on the road &quot; in a desperate act &quot; and was hit by several vehicles , Vaud police said in a statement .
clearly looking to kill herself , the victim , a Swiss woman aged 49 , was hit by several vehicles including a lorry .
she died at the scene .
several of the drivers involved have already been interviewed but some are still unidentified , said police , who are calling for them and anyone else who witnessed the incident to come forward .
a criminal investigation has been opened , a &quot; logical &quot; step in a situation like this , lawyer Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Geneve .
however it remains to be seen if any of the drivers involved will face charges .
was it possible to avoid impact ?
that &apos;s what the prosecutor must determine , &quot; said Hofstetter .
two other similar cases in the past five years suggest that drivers will not be held responsible .
in each case - both of which involved a person walking on the motorway in the dark - it was judged that motorists cannot expect to come across a pedestrian on the motorway in the middle of the night , said the paper .
last year a police officer was acquitted of causing death by negligence after she hit and killed a man who was lying on the A1 near Paynerne one night in August 2014 .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had been drinking and had passed out on the road , the court heard .
the court found that the policewoman -- who was responding to an emergency call -- was driving in a manner that was justified and that the presence of a man on the road was a &quot; completely exceptional and unpredictable situation , &quot; the judge said .
anyone with information about Thursday &apos;s incident near Morges should call police on 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44 .
NASA climate model : Venus was once habitable
Venus was likely once habitable , according to the projections of a new NASA climate model .
scientists at NASA &apos;s Goddard Institute for Space Studies developed a model to explore Venus &apos; past using tools and algorithms similar to those employed by climate scientists .
the model was designed to determine whether or not Venus , with its hot , water @-@ less surface and CO2 @-@ chocked atmosphere , might have once hosted Earth @-@ like conditions .
scientists have previously suggested that Venus &apos; slow rotation rate is explained by its thick atmosphere .
but the latest simulation suggests Venus could have boasted a thin , Earth @-@ like atmosphere and still spun slowly .
the model also looked at the topography of early Venus .
the planet likely featured more dry regions than Earth , but once had enough water and geographical variability to host life and guard against rapid evaporation .
early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent dimmer .
&quot; in the GISS model &apos;s simulation , Venus &apos; slow spin exposes its dayside to the sun for almost two months at a time , &quot; GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio explained in a news release .
this warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds , which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from much of the solar heating .
the result is mean climate temperatures that are actually a few degrees cooler than Earth &apos;s today .
the model produced a story of Venus similar to the evolution previously hypothesized by planetary scientists .
though likely once habitable , Venus was -- over the course of several billion years -- exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light .
its oceans evaporated and its water vapor was burned away by ultraviolet light .
as its hydrogen escaped , all that was left was a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deathly greenhouse gas effect -- thus , the Venus we know today .
researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the journal Geophysical Research Letters .
Patrick Roy resigns as Avalanche coach
Patrick Roy resigned as coach and vice president of the hockey operations of the Colorado Avalanche on Thursday , citing a lack of a voice within the team &apos;s decision @-@ making process .
Colorado executive vice president / general manager Joe Sakic confirmed the move and noted that the club will begin a search for a new coach immediately .
&quot; for the past three years , I have carried out my duties as head coach and vice president of hockey operations for the Colorado Avalanche with energy , passion and determination , &quot; the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy said in the statement .
I have thought long and hard over the course of the summer about how I might improve this team to give it the depth it needs and bring it to a higher level .
to achieve this , the vision of the coach and VP @-@ hockey operations needs to be perfectly aligned with that of the organization .
he must also have a say in the decisions that impact the team &apos;s performance .
these conditions are not currently met .
Sakic , who hired Roy on May 23 , 2013 , thanked Roy for his contributions to the team .
&quot; Patrick informed me of his decision today , &quot; Sakic said .
we appreciate all he has done for our organization and wish him the best of luck in the future .
Roy was named the Jack Adams Award winner as the league &apos;s best coach during his rookie season with the Avalanche in 2013 @-@ 14 .
he guided the club to 112 points and a first @-@ place finish in the Central Division , but Colorado was upset by Minnesota in the first round of the playoffs and has missed the postseason in each of the last two years .
the Avalanche posted a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 mark in 2015 @-@ 16 and fell five points shy of the Wild for the second wild @-@ card spot in the Western Conference .
a Hall of Fame goaltender , Roy won four Stanley Cups -- two apiece with the Montreal Canadiens and the Avalanche .
North Sea oil workers resume talks , suspend strike
labor strikes over pay for North Sea oil workers are suspended while all parties to the dispute sit down for a new round of talks , lead negotiators said .
strikes against oilfield services company Wood Group have been staged sporadically on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; wood Group and the Unite and RMT unions can confirm we have agreed to restart the process for resolution of the current dispute , &quot; a joint statement read .
we will hold a number of full @-@ day meetings over the next few weeks , starting early next week , to take a fresh look at the issues .
the labor unions said their recent action , which they said is the first in more than 25 years , was in protest of potential pay cuts of up to 30 percent .
wood Group this year cut rates paid to its North Sea contractors by about 9 percent because of negative market pressures .
the company &apos;s rate reduction follows a 10 percent decrease for onshore contractors in 2014 .
the company said additional cuts would give the company the room needed to move through the market downturn .
shell , for its part , has trimmed thousands of people from its payroll and announced plans to leave oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries as it streamlines its operations in the wake of its mega @-@ merger with British energy company BG Group .
energy companies are under pressure from lower crude oil prices , an economic situation compounded by the British decision in June to leave the European Union .
Scottish Member of Parliament Dave Anderson met with labor leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labor disputes to strike the North Sea in a generation .
the North Sea , he said , is vital for the regional economy .
&quot; in the North Sea and right across the country , we need an economy that works for the many and not just the few , &quot; he said in a statement .
less than $ 1.4 billion in spending on new projects in the North Sea is expected in 2016 , compared with an average of around $ 7 billion in the past five years .
Kepler measures spin rates of stars in Pleiades cluster
the latest mission by the Kepler space telescope has helped astronomers collect the most complete catalog of spin rates among the stars of the Pleiades cluster .
the new data is helping astronomers understand why stars in the cluster spin at varying rates , as well as how rotation periods relate to planet formation .
&quot; we hope that by comparing our results to other star clusters , we will learn more about the relationship between a star &apos;s mass , its age , and even the history of its solar system , &quot; Luisa Rebull , a research scientist at Caltech &apos;s Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena , said in a news release .
the Pleiades cluster is situated 445 light @-@ years from Earth .
many of the stars in the cluster are just now reaching adulthood , having been born roughly 125 million years ago .
they &apos;re spinning as fast as they ever will .
at their peak spin rates , these maturing stars eject large amounts of stellar wind .
as these winds travel across the stars &apos; magnetic fields , they enact a braking effect on the stars .
as a star ages , its spin rate begins to slow down .
Kepler measures each star &apos;s spin rate by tracking the time between the appearance of recognizable starspots -- like sunspots .
the latest catalog of spin rates suggests more massive stars spin more slowly than less massive stars .
Rebull likens the stars to dancers , larger ones pirouetting more slowly than smaller ones .
&quot; in the &apos; ballet &apos; of the Pleiades , we see that slow rotators tend to be more massive , whereas the fastest rotators tend to be very light stars , &quot; said Rebull .
because the Pleiades cluster is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities with spin rates .
&quot; the Pleiades star cluster provides an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation going both directions , younger and older , &quot; said Rebull .
we still have a lot we want to learn about how , when and why stars slow their spin rates and hang up their &apos; dance shoes , &apos; so to speak .
Rebull and her colleagues detailed their latest analysis of Pleiades spin rates in three new papers , soon to be published in the Astronomical Journal .
according to Zheng Jianjun , the Management Section Chief of Nanhu Park Water Area , the deepest point of the South Lake is more than 10 meters deep . people who do not understand the situation of water are probably confronted with danger .
&quot; although the Nanhu Park rescue team is very professional , we still hope that the majority of rowing tourists can wear life jackets and stay away from illegal activities on the lake to play safely &quot; Zheng Jianjun said .
Wai Tau Tsuen boasts a unique marine environment , with two leisure travel resources including natural ecology and cultural ecology .
&quot; however , several owners who bought the parking spaces in the community feared that this would affect the price of their parking spaces and doubted that others were selfish , so they had been plotting for bad things . this had shelved the parking space transformation . &quot;
as for the question about when the sweet potatoes are introduced and by whom , there are still many different versions in the academic community .
in the current mainstream view , there are three major lines for the introduction of sweet potato .
among the three lines of introducing sweet potato , the introduction by Chen Zhenlong from Philippine to Fuzhou is the one with the greatest impact and largest communication .
Beijing Municipal Social Management Office will soon carry out special inspections on the use of unified receipts of social group membership fees .
inspection is divided into two categories , unit self @-@ examination and spot inspection .
relevant person in charge of the municipal association said , the scope of the inspection covers social groups who received unified receipts of social group fees in the social mass organization between 2013 and 2015 .
&quot; the success of the Olympic Games is defined by people who share stories in social media , &quot; said the Rio Olympic Organizing Committee while establishing the communication strategy of 2012 Olympic Games .
from the news reports of the Olympic Games , all media have made a lot of changes in the aspect of mode of transmission , product form , language style , news perspective and many other aspects .
it seems that the International Olympic Committee and the media practitioners around the world will have to meet this round of challenges .
on August 11 , this is the last day for the open sale of Everbright Securities H shares . news went that the market response was not special for market of the previous two days . according to the plan , it will be listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on August 18 .
a domestic brokerage analyst said that the Orient Securities in Hong Kong did not enjoy a good foundation . only its capital management business is its strength . it has many inherent problems compared with Bank of China International and CITIC Securities , etc .
experts pointed out that with the return of the securities market to flatness , many brokers sagged this year in results . but the detailed situation of the listed companies is dependent on the detailed development of the corporate business and cannot be generalized .
after the introduction of the regulation of the new deal , Suzhou will become the first second @-@ tier city to restart the purchase restriction .
in addition to Suzhou , other second @-@ tier cities including Hefei and Nanjing will also introduce the property market regulation and control policies .
prior to this , Hefei has been the first to issue restrictions on lending policy . for people who have two suites in Hefei and have one housing loan not paid , they will be denied with the mortgage services from bank .
